Apparently the dude had gained access to my EA account also.    I bought FIFA 25 a few days ago to play online with my friends, but then realize my account is blocked. So i only have access to offline and no online.\xa0  Right now all my friends are playing without me.\xa0  It is impossible to reach EA in anyways. There is a number you can call, but they just state that you should reach them in a different way. No e-mail. No chat. NO NOTHING.\xa0    There is a contact form you can fill out (Which i did) and maybe you will here back from EA in 10 days.\xa0  This is just so incredibly frustrating that i am not able to get my account unlocked so i can play.\xa0  I did not know EA had turned into the new RyanAir with same level of support. Completely unacceptable.\xa0  What do i do!?', 'Hi everyone, I’ve been playing Overwatch for quite a while now, with over 1500 hours in the game, but lately the experience has become really frustrating. Most of my matches this season feel extremely unbalanced. I’m often matched against coordinated enemy teams with players who clearly know what they’re doing, while my own team frequently includes players with very few hours, little game sense, and no team coordination. It’s making the game feel more like a grind than something fun. My winrate this season is definitely below 50%, and just today I lost 9 games and barely managed to win 1 and that one win was an exhausting struggle. I understand that matchmaking isn’t easy to balance perfectly, but I’m really starting to lose motivation to play. I just want fair, enjoyable games where both teams have a chance and I’m not constantly fighting uphill. Anyone else feeling the same? Would love to hear if there are any plans to improve this. Thanks for reading.', 'It has the foundations of a great game, and is certainly worth the money, but at least for now don\'t expect to get more than 100 hours out of it. It is a lot of fun as a new player, and you will really enjoy the journey progressing to up to the highest level of difficulty.\n\nWith that said...\n\nThe content difficulty scales in a very linear way by simply throwing more and more heavy armored enemies at you, which makes for a very repetitive meta in which you only take very specific loadouts if you want any chance of completing the hardest content. To make it worse, if you do take the meta loadouts then even the hardest difficulty (9, Helldive) becomes trivial. There is not much middle ground either, except maybe if you are playing with a group of 4 competent friends and successfully use some of the ""worse"" equipment that can pass content with careful teamwork. Even if they introduce a lot more variety to the types of encounters players see, that is only the beginning of the balance issues in the game. I would argue more than half of the weapons and armor in the game are just borderline useless at the highest levels of difficulty.\n\nSpeaking of the most challenging content, like I said its actually really easy. This leads me to worry they will be balancing the most challenging content around the experience of players in public lobbies with people not using voice comms. There is a lot of pressure on developers from players to water down the most difficult content so that the average person doesn\'t feel left out. For whatever reason most people get turned off by the idea that they would need to make friends with other human beings in order to complete the most difficult content in a game. I get that talking to strangers in a public lobby isn\'t usually a good experience, but this can be easily resolved by slowly building up a large pool of players on your friends list that you had a good experience playing with. Its a mistake to rely on quickplay or matchmaking, and I kind of blame modern game devs for pushing matchmaking so hard to the point that people forget how to make friends.']"

Even her pick rate now is 0.55% (was 0.59% last time I watched). I’m not going to base everything on stats, but all the (former) Top500 (stuck in Masters) players say the same: she still feels terrible. Why? Because she’s not allowed to use her beam. She’s a squishie that is so easily punished by EVERYONE else for approaching at the beam range. Her new hitbox turned her even more into a glass elephant. They failed at making Symmetra useful again. Her playstyle is so boring: hide around corners all the time, be scared of your own life, avoid any 1v1, TP away from the slightest chaos. At this point I’m not even going to play this game until they do something meaningful (obviously, at least a HP buff, possibly also a buff to her secondary fire). And no, it’s not just the meta. Symmetra has had a positive winrate since many years at least, OTPs have made her work in any meta and have taken advantage of her kit in any scenario. She’s just never been this bad.', 'Man I played her so much and she was so fun, but after these recent nerfs, I find her way less fun to play and the value you get out of her feels not as great as other heroes. Anyone else feel the same, different?', 'Symmetra is in the worst shape she’s been in since her initial 3.0 rework. She has less health, her beam damage decays faster, her alt fire does 20 less damage even if it is faster, and her turrets deal a net 45 less dps than they did. Her teleporter is better but it is literally just a revert to the way it was before they made it infinite in 1. There’s just nothing about Symmetra that makes her fun and dynamic to play anymore. Her damage isn’t threatening enough, she can’t hold her own in duels due to the breakpoints necessary to kill her being lower, her area denial is gutted, and TP bombs aren’t even a viable meme strat anymore because the turret damage is so much worse. Photon Barrier is a good ultimate but it’s not enough to prop up how lackluster every single part of her is these days. I have played Sym since 2016, through all her different incarnations, and I’ve always found a way to enjoy playing her no matter what she was like. However, now I just can’t find anything enjoyable about playing Sym because she is getting absolutely bodied by everyone, even characters she should counter.']"

The only tanks who will benefit from the passive is doom and ball, but even then it’s probably so low compared to their health pools that they’d be out of combat waiting for it to heal them for so long they’d just get their whole team killed.

(X and Y were the last good pmon games don\'t @ me) Comparatively Palworld is less buggy and better graphically than Violet and Scarlet and 100+ hours of content (more with multiplayer) whereas V/S was like a 30 hour game. Is Palworld perfect? No but it\'s certainly better than anything game freak has put out modernly AND the devs claim palworld is only 60% complete! Palworld is a MUCH needed evolution and modern take on the monster catching genre. \n\nIF I was nitpicking my complaints would be- \n1. We NEED a base management UI for assigning pals. The ""throw a pal at it"" mechanic rn is a mess and can be very frustrating ESP when breeding. \n2. In base pal AI could be ""fixed"" pals frequently get stuck on things or outside the base boundary, then starve/fall/die. Pals also need to stay assigned to jobs. I found myself many times using pals that would only do a single thing just so they wouldn\'t be able to stop doing their assignment. What is the point of assigning a pal if it\'s just going to go do other things?|\n3. Boss timers that show up when you hover over their icon in the map. Having to just guess when a boss is going to re-spawn gets old. \n4. The building system could be refined. It\'s perfectly functional as-is but very simple and limiting for players who might want to build more elaborate and creative bases.   \n\nOverall great game. Lunaris and Quivern are my favorite Pals <3', ""So far this game, despite the early access feel to it, has been an extreme blast.\nAs of writing i'm about 70 hours in on a dedicated server I've set up with some friends with default game settings.\n\nThe Good:\n- Exploring feels rewarding.\n- Huge diverse map with different biomes and pals.\n- Good amount of pals available right from the start\n- General progress of unlocking stuff feels good.\n- Boss fights are challenging and chaotic.\n- Tower fights (gym battles) scale well when there are more people.\n- Base building is decent, see below.\n- Good amount of aesthetic assets to decorate your base.\n- Variety between pals.\n- Lucky pals are a nice addition.\n- (Cross) breeding for good stats on pals is cool.\n- Saddles / guns for certain pals. \n\nThe Neutral:\n- Even the most rare pall is not that rare, would like to see pals that are actually really hard to find (and catch).\n- Visual bugs.\n- Stuck in animations, like throwing pal spheres.\n- Snap points in base building somewhat clunky, like stairs.\n- Some pals are useless. They don't have proper fighting capabilities or aren't of any use in camp.\n- SAN can drop inexplicably fast.\n- Leveling becomes somewhat annoying since you (mostly) rely on catching 10 of each.\n- Too many teleport possibilities in my opinion, kinda removes the open world feel to me.\n- Technology tree. E.g. you'll learn to make something with refined ingots before being able to craft the ingot themselves. \n- Weight system needs to be changed, you encumber really easy.\n\nThe Bad:\n- AI pathing, both pals and human Npc's. Needs a lot of improvements.\n- Pals only raise their food bar to half instead of full, resulting in eating very often.\n- Pals get stuck in bases, becoming depressed, weakened, hungry and fractured.\n\nAll in all i highly recommend this game, especially when you're with a group of players who want to try something else/new. Yes, it shares some similarities with another monster hunter/collecting game, but i can imagine it's hard to create something original when over a thousand already exists.\n\nIt definitely needs some improvements on things, but curious how this game will develop over the upcoming months.""]"

The unique gameplay between each hero never feels boring. But as of late we all have come to see that players are abusing the report system by mass reporting players in the group stacks and then telling others in match game to report X player because they did X thing just becuase they don’t like the person or they are salty because they lost.  I’ve recently lost a few accounts due to Abusive chat and Gameplay Sabotage reports. Even tho I have Voice chat and game chat disabled in comp play and I potg most of the time on my Rein and Hanzo Mains as a Solo Q. I think we all have notice blizzard has moved away from real people doing reviews of submitted reports vs accounts and has turned to a Bot style reply system. I can’t think of any game I’ve ever played that there is no appeal system for when you are reported or system action is taken vs your account. So basically with Overwatch 2 you are just guilty no trial no telling your side of the story or providing proof the report agasint you is false. Since we all know blizzard has no intention of hiring real people for customer support. I have an idea that might help reduce or weed out players that mass report each game for no legit reason. If Blizzard added a monitoring system on player submitted reports.  So let say your account can submit X number of reports over X Time limit. If you exceed this number your account is now flagged for review and any related reports sent will now come under review by a REAL PERSON GM. It’s a simple idea but the current system has no personal downsides for just spamming reports every game vs any player you want. The report feature should be turned into a double edge sword from now on. If you report without a real reason I believe your account should take a hit. Just thought I’d vent / throw out an idea I had before season 9 releases. Because atm even with all the new shinny UI updates and changes to the Ranking system being more visible. It still won’t solve players abusing the report system if it stays as it is. GL in your matches!', 'I logged into OW just now and received 2 warning notifications saying I have been reported multiple times recently for abusive chat. I rarely type in chat anymore and I never use voice communication. I know how people abuse the reporting system in this game so I hardly ever communicate in the game to avoid false reporting as much as I can. Well it seems it isn’t enough after getting these 2 warnings. Thinking back on all of the matches I have played in the past couple of months (which haven’t been that many) I can’t think of anything I have said that could would make someone feel like it needed to be reported. In fact I avoid typing in chat so much I can’t even remember anything I have said in the game recently. This really just has me thinking this was only done out of spite from either playing a hero someone didn’t like or some other reason like this. This is out of control. The report system in this game is the most easily abused thing ever. To get these automated messages after logging in makes me believe that the system will just automatically take action against my account just for receiving a certain number of false reports in a certain amount of time. The idea seems to be “well if you’re getting this many reports then obviously you’re doing something wrong.” Here is the problem with that: EVERYONE knows how the system works and they know if they report someone enough it’ll cause automatic action to be taken against them. Players use the report system as a means to attack other players they don’t like for whatever reason. So, I don’t know what else to do at this point because this isn’t the first time this has happened to me. I have been playing OW since day 1 and I just know one day my account is going to be suspended forever over false reports. I will not be spending anymore money on this game. I am not purchasing anymore battle passes, cosmetic, bundles, missions or anything. Until I see substantive and noticeable changes to how the reporting system in this game works I will not spend anymore money on it. Why should I if I can lose it all because someone decided they can just report me for no reason? This needs to change now.', 'Hello I have a question in regards to suspension on accounts and I would really like to understand. I have a friend who is currently suspended for a month due to “abusive chat.” They have in the past been abusive to other abusive players and we all know how hard it is to hold back when it’s toxicity but they are aware now of how serious blizzard takes reports. I’ve been reading that blizzard report system bans accounts/ gives warnings based off volume of reports rather than looking into each report on a player. That being said, my friend is asking that after their suspension is lifted, if they do not interact at all negatively to other players but they get mass reported by other players for not switching heroes or not playing the way other players want them to, what would happen? I have seen it is a trend to call and ask game chat/team chat to mass report a player countless of times in games if, for example: they don’t switch off Widowmaker or they get accused of throwing a game for not having so much healing as support. So if bans/suspension truly come from volume of reports rather than actual reports that are genuine, how does one combat that from turning into account suspension? Should she disable chat all together? My friend has also stated that when asking for chat log of reasons why they were suspended this time (as they believed they haven’t been toxic this time), support refused to tell them why even though they have provided the logs or reported messages in the past. That’s a different story']"

Helldivers can now all dive together, as was always intended! Review has been changed to positive and the game is being reinstalled as we speak. \n\nEDIT: Sony has reversed their decision to force PSN account linking for PC players. This is a relief and a step in the right direction. Once Sony resumes selling Helldivers 2 in all regions again now that the reason they were de-listed is moot, I will change my review to the positive one the game genuinely deserves. Thank you Arrowhead for your hard work and for fighting for the health of your game. \n\nThis is a fantastic game created by Arrowhead Game Studios that has been ruined retroactively by Publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment.\n\nIf linking PSN accounts wasn't feasible at launch, the game should have been delayed. Launching a game with a mandatory requirement temporarily disabled while still selling the game in regions that cannot meet that mandatory requirement once it begins being enforced is beyond unacceptable. There should have been a plan or alternative in place for these regions at the very least, but ideally PC players should not have to link a PSN account at all. If I wanted to use my PSN account I would have gotten the game for PlayStation. Sony is notorious for data breaches, I do not want to add another chance of my data being stolen.\n\nGenuinely, do not make linking a PSN account a mandatory requirement to play this game. Do not cut off access to the game to over 60 regions. June 4th is the cutoff for players who had already purchased the game to begin having to link their PSN account; if the decision to require linking a PSN account to play Helldivers 2 isn't reversed by then, I will be requesting a refund. If I cannot get a refund, I will take that loss and simply uninstall and walk away. If the decision is reversed, I will return to this review and change it to reflect the truly great game Helldivers 2 is."", 'fuck helldivers and psn', 'The players got Sony to back down.

I think its safe to say that 4/20 games at this point usually involve a leaver which NEVER gets backfilled, why you might ask? Simple - because people who would leave games to backfill into new games are now being suspended for hours rather than being allowed to simply backfill into a game. The result is now you will end up with a full-length game that is 3v5 or 4v5 for 90% of the QP game. But if you LEAVE you get suspended. So all the players that would normally have just left are now not being queued into new games to form a new 5v5. In our attempts to get rid of leavers, we have now created a situation where the matchmaker doesn’t have enough sticks to count to 10.', 'If you leave 4 out of 20 games, you dont get a time out anymore, instead your account is marked as a leaver for 4 games and youre now in leavers queue, which means you only get to play with and against other notorious leavers. If you leave again, the leaver marking duration just gets higher and higher and you dont get to play with the pool of regular players with a normal completion rate of games. Why is this better than the current system? A leaver who doesnt learn his lesson and keeps leaving is only bothering other leavers, but players with a high completion rate of game are protected from leavers right from the get go for at least 4 games, while previously they only had a 10 minute time out. Leavers hopefully realize how bad their behaviour is by constantly having to deal with other leavers someone who ends up in the 4 game leaver penalty zone, because they genuinely had irl issues such as internet disconnect of no fault of their own, or an emergency came up, still gets to play the game without having to wait for it, even though the match quality drops for a few matches.']"

Examples: Kiriko’s skin locked behind bundle Mercy’s Rose Majesty skin locked behind bundle Freja’s first legendary skin locked behind $40 bundle And now Wuyang’s first legendary skin? Yep $40 bundle again. To make it worse, the bundle descriptions STILL say “individual items are available in the Hero Gallery.” That’s flat out wrong. This isn’t even about the money at this point. It’s about trust. Blizzard literally wrote that skins would be separate, then silently reversed it and never said a word. So what’s the deal? Is the policy dead?

It is not difficult to navigate for pirate areas, mining fields, high combat zones and stars. All you need to find is easily found on the left menu of your ship.\r\n\r\nThis game will never give you what directions to take to do things which means your left lost in space until you find something to do.

There are so many planets with the exact same resources with sometimes copper and sometimes other materials. Why not have one planet have completely different resources than the other? Grinding that's why.\r\n\r\nAt least in Elite Dangerous, you know its more about flying your ship around in space, DOING THINGS IN SPACE than going to planets to start bases because the game told you to. Good games without instructions are games like Minecraft and Terraria because its all on one place where it has everything, you just need to get off your ass and explore. If exploration is interesting then there is a gameplay loop, which this game does not have. Even fucking Starfield has a gameplay loop and that game is also crap in its own rights.\r\n\r\nThis games is like Blender, being the jack of all cards. Being able to do everything in a space game without actually being able to provide value for it. Elite Dangerous will get you somewhere much better if you want to look into learning and exploration because its not so much focused on NOTHING. Its a spaceship simulator with jobs you can do as long as you can play the game in the time it wants you to complete the missions. The only tedious things to worry about are learning about ship specs for weapons and combat, and learning how to use the ship on keyboard (unless you have a joystick and throttle + voice attack).\r\n\r\nNo Man's Sky do fucking better.""]"

Simply ad a LOS to it, and give it a longer charge time than current rez, and it solves two problems. The first is that rez was not meant to be in 5v5, as mercy will always rez the tank and its not fair to anyone else on the team. The second is that mercy can now become more of a team player, and you will all benefit from playing as a team when mercy has ult(due to LOS). 3: Remove ability to GA to soul. This would make it so mercy HAS to Ga to her teamates that are alive, thus adding to teamplay more(plus there is no reason to glide to a soul if you dont have rez anyway). It would also mean mercy is truly dead when her team is dead, as she can no longer randomly escape from everyone with souls. This means she HAS to keep her team alive as lo9ng as possible, no more coward mercys running away.', 'Both teams have a mercy and your team has a echo and you copy there mercy to rez your mercy so your mercy can rez someone else.']"

The Xbox one x is definitely the last Microsoft console I'll ever purchase. Last gen I owned both the ps4, the Xbox one x and used the ps4 far more regardless of the fact that the Xbox one x had better graphics. I sold the regular Xbox one almost immediately after realizing that th rd ps4 was basically better at everything. It's honestly sad because I was a gigantic Xbox fan but the company completely destroyed the brand in a short period of time. The original Xbox and 360 were amazing because they offered powerful hardware for a cheap price and provided gaming experiences that was previously only available on the pc. There was a massive difference between the Xbox and Playstation 2 when it came to hardware. It kind of seems like we've hit a roadblock when it comes to graphics/hardware. I remember a\xa0 friend telling that graphical leaps wasn't going to go much farther after the Xbox 360 because of the way that graphics cards are designed and he was 100% right. I wish that Microsoft would have made better decisions with the Xbox one 😔. They should have released something close to the Xbox one x at the very beginning to beat the ps4 hardware and focused on making new unique exclusives instead of sequels to shooter's. The Xbox 360 had a ton of unique experiences but the Xbox one just felt like sequels of sequels.\xa0"", 'Bad, tbh. Feels like the Xbox as I knew it growing up is gone, with a new one incapable of sticking to a vision. We’re witnessing irreparable damage being done to Xbox by Microsoft, and it already feels too late to correct course.\n\nBefore the start of the generation, it felt like Xbox were making all the right moves: expanding Xbox Game Studios to solve the exclusives problem; bolstering Game Pass with day one releases; and having hardware that was lower performant with its competitor.\n\nOver the last few years, Xbox have squandered their chance to wipe the slate clean from the Xbox One. Almost 4 years into the generation, we still have not seen Xbox release consistent first-party titles, with constant dry periods. Now some of the studios that were supposed to be boost that are being shut down. Wanted an exclusive Dishonoured from Arkane Austin? Nope. What about another Hi-Fi Rush from Tango Gameworks? Nope.\n\nI think most recently has been the most harming part though. With Activision-Blizzard behind Game Pass, it really felt like there was a chance to be competitive. But no, Xbox has only put 1 game in the service in 6 months. And we now live with an Xbox that doesn’t like the word “exclusive”. From refusing to talk about Blade in any capacity around Xbox in December, to now bringing games to PS5 and Switch. \n\nWe’ve known for a long time that Microsoft has been looking to change the way Xbox competes. We saw that with PC in 2016 and Game Pass in 2018. But destroying exclusivity on Xbox before they even actually deliver on the vision they set out with in 2018 is disappointing. Xbox is very dead, and the decisions made by Xbox over the last few years are what killed it.', ""The negativity comes from the fact that more and more people are realizing that in a few years there will be no more Xbox consoles. You don't need to make it complicated because gamers are not complicated, they are where the games are.\n\nPC = All Playstation and all Xbox games\n\nPlaystation = All Playstation and all Xbox games\n\nXbox = Xbox games only\n\nGamePass will continue to be a success and MS will become a third party publisher.\n\nFor gamers who are not yet in the Xbox ecosystem, there is simply no reason to switch to Xbox because there are no games that can only be played on Xbox.\n\nPlayers are where the games are! Proof? -> Nintendo Switch. \n\nNobody has a Switch because it has such good hardware and you can play 4k raytracing 60 FPS. The Nintendo Switch has a good chance of soon becoming the most successful console of all time because of the games you can only play on the Switch! \n\nAnd Nintendo has started from 0 as usual. The Xbox argument “We lost the generation where people started building their online libraries” doesn't count.\n\nEvery gamer on the Switch started with an empty digital library and there are currently 141 million Switch sold. How does that work? Many good games that are only available for the Switch. It can be so simple.\n\nWhat if Nintendo released all its games on the PC and Playstation?\n\nThey would become a pure third party publisher because then nobody would have a reason to buy a Switch if you could get all the games on PC/Playstation.\n\nThat's exactly what MS is going through right now and the Xbox as a console just doesn't fit in anymore.""]"

Disclaimer: Playing devil’s advocate here. I understand that there are a lot of players out there right now that want to see hero bans in Overwatch because of how successful it is in Marvel Rivals, but please understand that adding hero bans into Overwatch will amount to nothing. Before I can explain why hero bans won’t work in Overwatch, we need to look at why you would even want hero bans in the first place, and really it all just comes down to variability. The entire purpose of having hero bans is to give the players the option to ban characters that would otherwise cause the gameplay to become stale, boring, repetitive, etc. It’s really as simple as that; whether you’re banning the strongest characters or someone’s strongest picks, it’s all done to ensure that every match feels different and you’re not constantly playing against the same thing, i.e., variability. Anyway, the reason that hero bans will not work in Overwatch is because the developers already went down an alternative path to ensure there’s variability in matches by building the game around counterpicking. If you don’t understand why counterpicking would be such a problem when it comes to hero bans, let’s just quickly look at an example of how hero bans might play out in Overwatch. Example: Team A bans Zarya, and Team B bans D.va. The tank player on team A sees that D.va has been banned and decides to play Hog. The tank player on team B sees that the tank player on team A is playing Hog and decides to switch to Mauga to counter them. Looking at this example, what exactly has hero bans done for the game? The short answer is nothing. Hero bans don’t actually do anything for Overwatch because Overwatch isn’t balanced around overall strength; it’s balanced around the exploitation of weaknesses. In Marvel Rivals, if the enemy team bans Groot and Magneto.

The game is somehow getting less and less  fun after every update especially since the devs who do the balancing seems  to hate fun.  Not  to  mention the new warbond Polar Patriots was just released and is the most underwhelming and quite frankly the worst warbond in  the  game to date and yet there are no  new armor  passives either. I hate having fun with weapons right now because i know  if i have to much fun the devs  are going to  nerf it into the ground and make it entirely unusable.\n\nEdit 2: The devs released an  update that seems to have listen to  a lot of community issues and was dubbed the buffdivers update and the game is  in a great place right  now  and is a lot  of fun.

The alternative is to move Doomfist back to the Damage Role, and Rocket Punch would be Impact Damage + slight knockback (no slow, no stun), and you could incorporate Empowered Punch’s AOE aspect into regular Rocket Punch so that Doomfist would deal less burst damage than OW1 Doomfist, but still be viable because he’d do more AOE damage.

In the recent weekly challenges we get less EXP as the challenges are fewer now. These last two seasons I barely finish the 200 levels on the premium tier(still struggling) so it got really hard and I do all weeklies and dailies each time, while dedicating a decent amount of time to the game. Why make things really hard if the premium tiers are unlocked for the players who bought and PAID the Battle Pass anyways? This has to change.', 'I had a pretty busy schedule last week so I did not get to play at all, I thought it would be fine because the weekly challenges carry over to the next week now, and with a free schedule i’d be able to complete two sets of weeklies. However, I have just completed all the weekly challenges for week 2, and yet I still do not see last weeks challenges appearing for me to complete, instead it says i’ve completed week 1 and i’m 2/3 progress towards week 2. So have I just missed the 150 credits and the 5000 xp per challenge for the first week? If so that does not really count as them carrying over and being able to do them later in the season, yet for whatever reason I have two sets of the competitive advantage challenge. I’m very confused.', 'I haven’t seen anyone discussing it yet, but the changes to the weekly challenges is almost like the overwatch team is trying to disgust competitive players. I get that it is a game for casual players but with their only being 6 weekly challenges it means if you want to complete them unlike before when they were just there and you would get them by just playing around, now you have to decide you game time around them. Only play competitive, 2 of the challenges are impossible. Only play open queue, one of the challenges are impossible. Hate arcade, hope you like all the other challenges so you can get that 5 challenge bonus. It just seems like an unneeded change from what was there before, I get they are moving away from having the overwatch coins being rewarded but thats no reason to change it from what it was']"

At the moment, Hog’s hook combo can be inconsistent depending on who you hook and where you hook. For example, if you hook someone on high ground or someone that is in the air (e.g mercy), it’s impossible for the pellets to connect to the head and Hog loses out on a kill. In the past, pig pen would secure a hook combo always, but that’s not the case anymore. The combo became inconsistent again. They need to change how the hook works. The hooked target should always end up right in front of Roadhog no matter what angle you hook them from so Hog can consistently execute the combo. Either that or they could just flat out buff his burst damage. Right now, it feels like the game punishes Hog for getting good hooks. There’s already so many things that can counter his hook, so at the very least his combo should be consistent. I don’t think this will make him good in 5v5, but at least Hog players wouldn’t feel cheated. It would make him more enjoyable to play. Hog probably needs more in 5v5, but at the moment this change would be appreciated. Regarding 6v6, it’s obvious he’s very strong atm. They should probably lower his self-sustainability in that particular mode.', 'I hope the terrible hog rework gets reverted for 6v6. Hog not getting punished anymore for getting stunned out of his TaB was only okay for 5v5 since hes the only tank on his team. For 6v6 however, this better not be a thing, it would just be too OP. Old breather was way better and you needed more of a brain to use it properly. You had to be aware if there were any stun characters around you and couldnt just use it in front of a cass, mei, etc… now it literally doesnt matter, your low, use breather, you get stunned, use it again, its just so no skill i hate it. His old right click required more skill than his current shot. And remove pig pen its the worst ability in the game. Give him his true one shot back and flank hog will finally be back. I think any hog main would take old hog over new hog, unless you like this no skill version of hog. And thank you devs for finally bringing back 6v6!', 'I played Roadhog for about half of my time on overwatch console but quit momentarily when I switched to PC and became a cassidy main. I have 200 hours on Roadhog and 190 hours on Cassidy. Now I play a lot of hog on PC because I stopped finding cassidy fun to play because of his stun now removed from the game. I started playing hog a lot ever since overwatch 2 came out. I am masters 5 on this account and masters 3 on another account only done with hog. I know that he is OP now and there is some that literally want hog out of the game but I hate to say it, but 5v5 is sort of what caused this ordeal for Roadhog, but lets not get out of context here. Now I know what you guys might say, “oh you are a hog player you have no say in anything.” That is true but when it comes to my favorite hero in the game I think I can definitely talk about it. Now I’m just going to say what I think is best for hog pre rework, and I’m 100% honest I don’t think hog needed a rework AT ALL!, he just needed some numbers buffed and nerfed here and there. Personally I think his scrap gun (left click) should shoot faster, keep 6 ammo and do less damage with slightly tighter spread along with his right click still being in, and I think that his breather rework is good and I think his trap is unnecessary only because It sort of made him still OP. I also think he should keep that 4 meter distance when an enemy is hooked because with tighter spread for his left click it can compensate for the distance. and his hook damage now is pretty balanced for the most part but again with all the deniability that support has it wouldn’t really matter. I really wish I had the ability to test this myself but I’m not a developer and I can only picture it in my mind so to some this may sound brain dead and it may not so this is just my opinion. Of course hog will be good no matter how much you nerf and buff him because of that little hook he’s got but I think that positioning plays a big part in hogs case. After all this is just my opinion.']"

I understand that there is a problem with the licenses in relation to certain teams, but as in the case of the club, it would be much better if it was possible without the real logo and uniforms. Is there any type of problem here?  There are many good teams missing, but I'm from Georgia and I'm interesting what kind of problem is there in adding the national team of Georgia? Is it a license violation or a restriction from EA?"", ""1. Team Tactics Info  I can't know Team Tactics  I can't know My player's role  Will FCIQ solve this issue?  2.

But National Teams is in the game."", 'Career mode has a lot of great things about it but it has many problems too. Seeing that the headline of this says career mode and not ultimate team (gambling simulator), this probably wont be read by a single EA employee   Customization - This is easily my biggest problem with career mode. There is absolutely no room for any sort of customization. With the exception of real players, you should be able to change name, height appearance, etc of generated players. The other day I got an English youth academy wonder kid the other day with 94 potential and five playstyles. The only issue was that his name was “Mason Mason.” I nearly put my controller through the TV. While this is not an issue for PC players, console players deal with this stupid stuff all the time. It’s absolutely ridiculous. Since you lot are so money hungry, why don’t you charge for an add on that allows for customization on Xbox and PS like Football Manager does? I’d certainly buy it so maybe that’ll get your attention.  Playstyles - This was actually a really good addition to the game. It makes players unique and the game is more fun to play. But whoever applied playstyles to career mode has a room temperature IQ. Why are they random? Why can’t you even train them? If I want a youth player with specific playstyles, why in the world do I have to keep reloading the game until I get it? It makes no sense whatsoever and ruins the gameplay and wastes time for the player.  EA Neglect - This is just a general problem. You lot do not care about career mode players at all. It’s a joke. Like I said above, you’d rather appeal to a 13 year old gambling addict using mommy’s credit card to buy packs than someone who’s been playing your game for a decade. Really shows how grimy you people are. Things like not having sliders for def awareness and composure, not being able to train free kick accuracy, unrealistic transfers, no customization, and other stupid glitches have been problems for years but they’ve been neglected by EA the entire time.\xa0       The career mode community has been very vocal about this game mode being deeply flawed for years, but the flaws persist. When are you lot gonna acknowledge them? My guess is probably never, but I hope someone sees this in hopes that at least they know how scummy they are.']"

Special rewards packs with „Guaranteed Category“ Players, e.g. Squad Battle Elite Level Rewards: I only get lowest ranked players and always the same lowest ranked multiple times. Is this a bug or just extremely unfavourable probabilities for higher ranked players?  Promo Packs: Once in awhile I purchase FC coins and buy packs. Recently I purchased two Fantasy FC (incl Hero) packs for 4000 FC coins each and got the same very low ranking Fantasy FC players twice! What are the odds? No Hero in sight, okay, but exactly the same super low ranking players? Really? I truely hope this is a bug, because if this how EA weighs the probabilities in these packs, then I will stop purchasing.  Overall very disappointing experience with packs in the last 3 months. The game play experience has really suffered. There was time when my son and I were excited to unpack together. The fun factor of pack opening is basically gone. The packs are only good for feeding SBC but otherwise the packs are disappointing and almost useless. In fact, to me unfortunately it has become a very disappointing and annoying experience.']"

I don’t have all the gold guns or even the ones I really want. Now I have to decide if getting a jade weapon is worth it or not use any of my points until the next season. Why not just make it where you have to get gold then jade? Why not make it one currency and we get the choice of which weapon we want?

It\'s DMC so that\'s good. Nero on the other hand really is not a great character to play. He should have more ability to juggle the hardest demons but really falls short of Dante. At least Dante from DmC. Let\'s see what do I like about this game? Well some of the music is really good. I like V and Nero. I like the characters. I\'m only on chapter 8 but Dante soon I gather. The story is cool; but doesn\'t feel as desperate as DmC\'s. \r\n\r\nLet\'s just go over why I think DMC fans who hate on DmC are stupid. DmC has better combat (developed by ninja theory) and that goes to show. DMC5\'s combat feels more sluggish and also you don\'t get anywhere near the amount of weapons or I feel like moves either. Nero\'s playstyle even if you upgrade his sword is still pretty generic. It\'s like in DmC if you just used Rebellion you\'re gonna get bored (Like I am in DMC5). \r\n\r\nI do really enjoy DMC5 but I get upset V\'s a lot better at getting SSS ranks than Nero can be. I also didn\'t mention I play the game on the hardest setting, so maybe that\'s the issue? I get A-SS-SSS in DmC, so I\'m not sure ""get gud nub"" is relevant here xD \r\n\r\nOh GOD THE CAMERA ANGELS PISS ME OFF SO ****ING MUCH IN THIS GAME. In DmC they allow you to rotate your camera similar to DMC but it feels more fluid and fast. Did I forgot to mention the worst ****ING aspecft of DMC? DODGING. OH MY GODS.. Why was it so hard to learn from DmC that A should be your dodge key, not RIGHT BUMPER A LEFT.. like wtf? I get SO PISSED at dodging in this game as Nero. \r\n\r\nOver all if you love DMC play them all, and and I can\'t praise DmC enough for it\'s music, level design, story (<3 u Kat) and Bob Barker, just doing God\'s work.\r\n\r\nI can\'t even think of a qoute to remember so far from DMC5 but I hope it comes along.', 'its DMC need i say more?']"

Has been for a long time. 25% damage boost? Why? Paired with the new DPS passive, that is pretty insane. I say remove Discord as an ability and bake it into his shots as a passive.

Purging a Harmony Orb deals burst healing of 150HP instantly but places Harmony Orb on a 5 second cooldown Purging a Discord Orb deals 50 damage and doubles the current Discord effect up to max 20% Discord becomes visible to team and only lasts for 5 seconds and doesn’t fall off target when line of sight breaks Discord can’t be applied to any target until this 5 second team Discord ends Purge is a 12 second cooldown This allows Zen to keep Discord without it being overbearing on Tanks while also rewarding Zen players for good aim. It also gives Zen some more utility in Hindering the right targets at the right time (made some edits)', 'It’s impossible to play most non shield tanks and close range tanks without Zen spamming discord orb on you and taking away 25% of your health bar for free value. Rework discord orb to only increase Zen damage at least on tank. Or at least make it 10% damage increase on tank. 25% is just ridiculous. Maybe give him the floating perk as a base ability if he’s too weak.', 'Zen main. Masters. Big grind. Zen now feels CLUNKY . New disc stupid easy to outplay. Having to hold discord = not fun… but old discord on tanks = not fun. Therefore… rework discord again. Damage boost (minus ults) not healthy for the game. Very unfun. Lowering icd on disc still won’t be fun. Rework mercy right click also. Compensate Zen so damage is same with discord. Maybe buff projectile speed. Maybe buff projectile size. Definitely reduce hitbox (Sombra = swap to brig). Right now Kiriko/Illari are better Zen’s than Zen. New orb should… Be spammable again. Not make enemy tank feel bad. Help aggressive teammates get kills (pref dive heroes). Help Zen when getting dove. My idea: Orb of [Something] - attach an Orb of [Something] onto the enemy. Allies (and Zen) who damage the target that is orbed will gain a burst of speed, quickly decaying over 2(?) seconds. Thought about lifesteal but free healing is bad for the game. Thought about quicker reload and/or attack speed but that should be for Mercy if reworked. More speed should help the team get more damage over time and will make them harder to hit (basically ghost healing). Thank you for coming to my Zen talk. Blizzard, feel free to contact me for more balance ideas.']"

In order to sell characters, it has similar story structure and worldbuilding - short story collections which sequentially center new characters. It has the common energy system, character upgrades gated through arbitrary grind, FOMO banners and events, shallow character writing, and so on. It uses a class mechanic to artificially inflate the minimum number of characters a player needs to tackle all content. It makes it's story easy enough for most people to keep up, but has endgame which paying makes significantly easier, but is still (mostly) completable for F2Ps that make a bit of an effort. It power creeps old characters to sell new ones, while still leaving some reasonably accessible options available.\n\nOutside of the 3d graphics and open world, Genshin really isn't that different from any other gacha game - and even then, the influence it's had isn't total. No other game went in as hard on a giant open world as Genshin. Wuwas map is way smaller than Genshin. HSR is basically linear.

But, regardless, hes just not as fun as he could be. Cassidy made me love overwatch, that feeling of aim dominance, and the clean transition of it with most of his abilities was just slick and smooth. Lately that feeling has been few and far in between, so, this is how i would balance cass. Cassidy -falloff changed from 25-35 meters to 25-40 meters. Alternatively Cassidys maximum falloff damage could be increased to 40-50% from 30%, and his falloff could instead be changed to 20-40 meters. Ultimately these accomplish the same thing of making Cass not shoot nerf bullets at mid to long ranges. -Health reduced from 225 to 200hp -magnetic grenade removed. - Flashbang -cooldown of 12 seconds. -Maximum Aoe reduced from 2 meters to 1.5 meters. Perhaps could have a reduced effect on tanks but thats subjective to how strong it ends up being in a 5v5 setting. Imo shouldnt be too bad. -Fan the hammer. Fire rate could be slowed with the reintroduction of flash, though id say with FTH just monitor the power as it goes, and if its to strong reduce the fire rate. -Combat roll -Damage reduction decreased from 75% to 50% Roll distance increased by 20% -high noon ult charge time decreased by 8% damage reduction lowered to 25% from 40% In conclusion: this would be a lot of buffs to the character, but i feel as though it wouldnt be too much considering the current state of the character, and the overall nerfs to his tankiness, getting him closer to what he should be, a sharpshooter cowboy, and the brawl/turtle hitscan alternative. And from this position he could easily be slightly tuned overtime to become more balanced. Would love feedback and your own opinions on Cass. The characters struggling balance wise and design wise, and i feel talking about it increases the chances of the cowboy making a comeback. Thanks.', 'its literally impossible to contest characters like ash, soldier, cassidy, in 1v1s and team fights, if you pick any projectile like hero like junkrat, genji, echo, pharah, hanzo literally anything thats not HITSCAN WILL ALWAYS LOSE TO A HITSCAN its so broken it restricts so much in team plays its crazy how OP it is and not talked about at all like you can shoot easier and do more damage then a projectile how is that fair dawg. my fix would be nerf the damage make it instead of 3 shots it would be 4 for a body shot and if you land a headshot you can still do 1 headshot and 1 body shot then dead for ashe and cassidy and same for soldier nerf his pulse rifle but i would say slightly increase the hit box size on these characters except when it comes to headshots.']"

It was released on Steam but has since been removed. I want to emphasize that I do NOT condone this type of content in any way. I find it deeply disturbing that such a game was created, and it’s unsettling to think someone even imagined the idea, let alone developed it. I struggled to write this without sounding like I might be defending such content, so I want to state clearly: I do NOT support it.\n\nWith that said, the situation got me thinking about something broader.\n\nWhy is it that, as a society, we generally accept video games that depict the murder of innocent people but are repulsed by games involving sexual violence?\n\nFor example, I’ve spent a lot of time playing games like GTA, Red Dead Redemption 2, and People Playground, a game centered around building contraptions to kill rag dolls in gruesome ways. These games allow, and often encourage, players to kill, sometimes indiscriminately. And yet, if any of them featured the option to commit sexual assault, I wouldn’t have downloaded them in the first place.\n\nWhen GTA was first released, it drew a lot of backlash for its violence and depiction of crime. But over time, much of that criticism faded, and it’s now widely accepted in mainstream gaming culture.\n\nThat leads me to wonder: Will games involving sexual violence ever reach a similar level of social tolerance?\n\nTo be clear, I’m not arguing that they should. I’m just trying to understand the cultural and psychological divide between how we treat depictions of murder versus sexual assault in media, especially interactive media like games.\n\nSo I guess I’m curious:\n\n\t•\tWhy do you think murder is so       normalized in video games?\n\n\t•\tDo you think sexual violence will ever be viewed the same way?\n\nI’m asking these questions from a place of curiosity and reflection, not endorsement.\n\nTL;DR:\nI came across a now-removed game that simulated rape and incest, which I strongly condemn. It got me thinking: why is murder so widely accepted in video games, while sexual violence remains taboo? I’m not advocating for that to change, but I’m curious why society views these acts so differently in the context of gaming.', 'I mean I don’t know that it will ever be held in the same regard. I would point out that game on steam was considered an adult game as is which is a huge market and has been cause the internet and video game industry’s evolved so closely together that porn and video games fused into its own genre. Even within the bound of those that enjoy sex the “freaks” of society aren’t really approving of that game in particular cause it is sexual violence no consensual sexual pleasure. Virtual or otherwise people don’t necessarily hold violence to the higher standard of sexual assault. Rape for example is treated as a much more serious story element in storytelling then say a solid fist fight. Viewers naturally recognize the serious and horrific nature of rape and many people sadly have been victims of sexual assault on a variety of levels and so it’s easy to connect and have sympathy for a character. Less people have had a direct experience with severe gun or weapon violence. Or even violence in general with a majority of people never experiencing violence in their adult lives obviously I’m excluding those who experienced child hood trauma of either sexual or physical violence as they are the exception not the rule. I truly believe a majority of people recognize Sexual Violence especially Full On Rape and treat it more seriously than physical violence and I also believe that because we can come on Reddit, instagram, tik tok, YouTube and you see people glorify Luigi or glorify any other violent act now. Hardly do I see people express any compassion or reverence for human life anymore and it’s disturbing how numb to physical violence and death we have become. If sexual violence became as direct and publicized as physical violence and even glorified like physical violence then yes it would be much worse', 'Sexual violence is MUCH more common than murder and attempted murder. More people have trauma related to sexual violence or know someone who\'s been harmed by sexual violence and therefore are more likely to have a strong negative reaction to depictions of it.\n\nAlso, a lot of people are looking for ways to reduce the level of sexual violence in our society, and that can include reducing depictions that seem to normalize it.\n\nAlso, what u/thegoldenbagel said--there are times when murder can be justified, but there\'s never a time when sexual violence is justified (unless a story goes *way* out of the way to spin it so that it\'s ""necessary"" but then that just leaves a bad taste in most people\'s mouths).\n\nOn a more personal level, as a person who\'s experienced both sexual violence and attempted murder, I\'ve found certain depictions of physical violence cathartic, but I\'ve never found depictions of sexual violence cathartic, even though I had more lasting trauma from the attempted murder than from the sexual abuse. I don\'t know why. There may be differences in the way the same brain processes these two types of trauma.']"

The most glaring issue is the consistent crashing due to ""out of memory"" errors. This is particularly baffling given that my setup includes a robust NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, which should theoretically handle the game with ease.\n\nHowever, the reality is far from this expectation. The frequent crashes disrupt gameplay, making it nearly impossible to immerse oneself in the magical world of Hogwarts. It\'s not just the crashing; there are also noticeable bugs and glitches that further detract from the experience. Given the game\'s high system requirements and the pedigree of the Harry Potter franchise, one would expect a smoother, more polished experience.\n\nMoreover, the developer\'s response to these issues has been lackluster. Despite numerous updates and patches, the core problems remain unresolved, making it clear that the game was not optimized well for PC. It\'s disheartening to see such potential wasted, as the game itself, when it works, offers a rich and engaging world that any Harry Potter fan would love to explore.\n\nIn summary, ""Hogwarts Legacy"" on PC is a letdown. Its technical shortcomings overshadow what could have been a captivating adventure in the Wizarding World. Until these issues are properly addressed, I cannot recommend this game, especially to those with high-end PCs who expect a game to run smoothly on their powerful hardware. It\'s a frustrating reminder that even the most promising games can falter without proper technical support and optimization.\n\nRating: 2/5 - Not worth your time until significant improvements are made.', 'It crashes ALL THE TIME. Game is perfect, I am not even a fan of Harry Potter. But these crashes. They are killing me', 'Harry potter But My Pc 70 FPS']"

Personally I would like to see the C.A.R revamped to address this issue by making it less accurate at long range or slower fire rate and having harsher recoil but higher damage with heavy ammo. I think it should be more accurate than the flatline but harder to control than the prowler, and with light ammo it should be slightly less accurate than the r-301 but better than the r99 at mid ranges with slightly lower fire rate and have damage per bullet be somewhere in between both. Since C.A.R stands for Compact Assault Rifle I think that either way you decide to go it should feel like an in between of the respective AR’s and SMG’s for heavy and light ammo rather than just feeling like an r99 but you can use two ammo types.']"

""frustrating"". (my lifespan decreased by 30%)\n\nfor example, the new Dragon roach was advertised as its wings being a weakspot, this is not the case. I will now list some issues with the Dragon roach.\n-Destroying the wings does not kill the Dragon roach.\n-Destroying the wings does not change the functionality of the Dragon roach.\n-The wings act effectively as armor, as only HALF of the damage is transferred to the main HP pool of 6,500.\n-The green acid breath does WAY too much fire damage (why is it fire damage and not acid? idk lmao), and the effect is SUPER inconsistent. ive been insta-killed through solid walls, and sometimes i get fully engulfed by the acid and take ZERO damage. \n-They spawn way too often, even on the lower difficulties.\n\nThe Dragon roaches arent the only new enemy that is super frustrating, but getting into that would make this ""review"" (complaint) way too long.\n\n\nFor the most part, all the older enemies are golden (except maybe bile spewers), but man these new enemies, Dragon roaches (insta-kill, enemy spam), Fleshmobs (bullet sponge, enemy spam), and Warstriders (ragdoll spam, enemy spam) all SUUUUCK. They just straight up make the game not enjoyable.\n\noh and btw, the performance is dog rn, and half of our gear sucks so bad its basically unusable on higher difficulties :)', 'The bot front became very unfun with the addition of war strider. It has zero weakpoints and replaces 90% of all hulks and tanks.\n\nI never liked bugs that much but at the very least each content drop was fun, and recently I very much enjoyed both the caves and hive lords. Problem is that AH removed the rotation of hive lords and roaches and the roaches are the worst enemy designed ever, like what was the thought process behind that. The only reliable way to  kill this flying bile titan spewing invisible fire with the same health and armour is the railcanon strike, which can not keep up with its spawn rates on difficulty 6.\n\nThe game is once again falling into a loadout check, no enemy should require half of the stratagems to be a counter specifically to them. Basically all non AT support weapons have become suboptimal, what is a shame because those are mostly unique, unlike the AT counterpart.', 'good ideas, just getting launched into orbit by a hive lord, being unable to properly dodge dragonroach and hive lord vomit, losing the objective instantly to a hive lord and getting getting hit from across the map by rupture enemies just isnt it']"

While Reaper was hard nerfed for the sequel. Reaper was nerfed in the OW2 Alpha for a build that no longer exists. For a DPS passive that no longer exists. Why is he still nerfed?

WHY does he have to remain a short range character when others have the advantage? WHy does he have to be the SLOWEST and shortest jumping character in the game?

People like him are an exception and most of us will never be THAT GOOD but that is NO justification to make Reaper have to stay as he is.

Reaper deserves to remove this age old animation of him throwing his guns down every  8 shots, it looks bad and again this leads to him being killed once that happens!  NOBODY throws down their guns after emptying them so why does Reaper have to?? Why can’t reaper have longer range ammo and MORE AMMO??

I am not an accessibility expert or advocate but I would guess that people who vouch for accessibility are actually thinking it's barely in its infancy and there needs to be much more research and implementation of accessibility settings for people with disabilities. \n\nThe thing I have trouble with in OP's situation, is that they are saying that some accessibility settings are a problem, but they are talking from the perspective of a person who does not need those settings. It's like somebody talking about how good or bad a certain wheelchair is when they do not use a wheelchair themselves. \n\nIf you are disabled yourself, I would defer to your opinion. I understand that people are not a monolith and everybody will have different opinions on what helps them or not. Given that I'm not in the disabled community, however, I have to first defer to disability advocates because they have first hand contact with the disabled community and probably came up with their accessibility recommendations through discussions with the community and research."", ""The options at issue here can be helpful for certain kinds of disability, but Assist Mode is primarily a difficulty setting, secondarily an accessibility feature (unless you think lack of skill is a disability). It's a nice bonus that Assist Mode makes the game more accessible for people with a very specific set of disabilities. But such disabilities are very rare. Most of the use case of the mode, and most of the conversation around it, is how it affects various of various skill levels.\n\nThe options at issue here, the godmode, are not an accessibility feature. If there is a person disabled enough to need a godmode to progress, that person cannot meaningfully interact with platformer in the first place. The godmode is purely to address frustration and lack of skill, that is, it's a difficulty setting, and a poorly-presented one at that, I'd argue."", 'The thing about accessibility options, is that they are specifically for disabled people. They normally should be tailored specifically to each disability (i.e. colorblind people get accessibility options that help them see the game better, etc.), but in the end there is always the possibility that your options are not enough. That\'s why I believe they introduced the ""problematic"" options like invincibility and infinidash, because they need to make the game playable for those people that they missed, and for those people whose disabilities they cannot realistically make accessible.\n\nIt\'s not perfect, but that is the nature of trying to provide accessibility to people on a limited, indie budget. And yes, it may harm the story and themes of the games. But that\'s just a tradeoff you have to make when you are trying to achieve another goal, which is to make the game more accessible for people with disabilities.\n\nIn the end, the only issue I see is maybe lack of communication. Maybe they should have warned people more about how some options break the game and harm the emotional payoff. But at the same time, how much do you want to be babied? At some point you have to hand off agency to the player and allow the player to make big person decisions by themself and accept the fact that their choices may have consequences. If the person is too new to understand how the options will affect their gameplay, then the community can step in a la Dark Souls.\n\nIn some ways this does tie into the bigger easy mode discussion because the arguments for letting difficult games have only 1 difficulty are similar to the arguments for letting Celeste have their imperfect accessibility options, **resources** and **developer intent**. As a person on the accessibility side, I think it\'s much more commendable to have overbroad accessibility settings that harm the gameplay then having no accessibility settings.']"

If anything prices came down. I got a board partner 3080 in 2021 for what was a high but common and even decent price at 999 including tax in a time where mining made it hard to find these cards for sale. There was no MSRP card straight from Nvidia available either.\n\nAnd now a 9070 XT with a 3 fan design from a board partner is around 600 bucks including tax and that has enough power and VRAM for 1440p and even 4k for many newer games as long as they are well optimized like Kingdom Come 2.\n\nThrow in a 7600X3D or even a cheaper Ryzen that doesn't have the special 3D cache and you can play almost anything on any modern 144Hz 1440p VRR monitor.\n\nA 32GB RAM kit that doesn't have the very best timings but will work fine with these Ryzens costs 100 bucks which isn't crazy to me either.\n\nSo I really don't know what I'm missing about prices because when I built my rig in 2021 everything was more expensive including RAM and the Ryzen I have is the 5800X that cost an arm and a leg (5700X not available yet) and didn't even have the 3D cache because that hadn't come out yet either.\n\nThe previous rig wasn't any better in pricing, first it had a 290X that was running so hot despite the better board partner cooling design and I ended up water cooling it which was still less expensive than replacing the 290X early. I remember the low frame rates with The Witcher 3.... eventually replaced it with an EVGA GTX 1080 and even though that was a crazy good improvement it basically cost twice as much. Like the 290X was about 400 bucks and the 1080 was 800 straight from the EVGA shop which had the lowest price at the time (July 2016). So that already felt like a ripoff.\n\nI'll keep my 3080 for a long time since it still runs everything but if I wanted to build a very decent gaming pc now I'd be happy about prices right now..."", ""I am confused too because all my previous gaming rigs were really at their limit despite paying extra for high-end parts like the ATI 290X back in 2013 or so that just ran hot and was honestly a terrible card.\n\nThen I bought the cheapest GTX 1080 when it came out which ended up being a EVGA 1080 through their own shop in July 2016 and that came out to 800 including tax. Twice the performance of the 290X but cost twice that too. It ran much cooler and better so I was happy but I found the beloved 1080 to be overpriced for what it was.\n\nNow I am thankfully happy with my 3080 from 2022. Even though it was a bad deal too at 999 including tax at least it still plays well optimized new titles like Kingdom Come 2 well even in 4k as long as I enable DLSS.\n\nBut then I look at the current gen 9070XT that's just 600 bucks with tax and now has decent FSR as well (which was previously only really visually good with DLSS on Nvidia cards) and I see there's a 32GB DDR5 kit for 100 bucks... not with the best timings but reasonable for a Ryzen 7. Isn't this a great deal?\n\nLike a Ryzen with 32GB and the 9070XT plus mainboard would come out to about 1k as long as you still have a case and power supply you can keep using. And that would be a very solid build for new games on any 1440p 144Hz VRR monitor.\n\nSure it's not a kind of 5090 high-end gaming rig but who are the pc gamers that would be unhappy using a 9070XT the next 3-4 years? I'd be the first to complain about anything less than stable 60fps and even I am happy with a 3080 going into 2026."", ""Hi All. Following the best practices of PC building I thought I could ask for a peer review! I want to get a new PC, since my previous one is already 10 years old and currently non-functional, but I haven't been in the PC building game since I got the last one so I feel quite lost on the current market. So far this is where my reseach led me\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7600X3D 4.1 GHz 6-Core Processor\n\nCPU Cooler: Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler\n\nMotherboard: ASRock B650 Steel Legend WiFi ATX AM5 Motherboard\n\nMemory: Crucial Pro Overclocking 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL36 Memory\n\nStorage: Samsung 990 EVO Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 5.0 X2 NVME Solid State Drive\n\nVideo Card: XFX Swift OC Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 GB Video Card\n\nCase: Montech XR\n\nPower Supply: MSI MAG A750GL PCIE5 750 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply\n\nNow, the main games I usually played back in the days where more CPU intensive (to the best of my knowledge) multiplayer shooters/survivals like Rust, Escape From Tarkov, CS:GO, Battlefield, R6S. Now I would love to come back to some of these with some actual playable framerates (On a QHD monitor), with an option to play newer editions of such shooters like BF6, ARC Raiders, so not a lot of graphically stunning AAA's\n\nAre there any visible issues/incosistencies that I may have missed? Are there other important questions that I should ask when considering a build for my usecase? If so, please feel free to ask them. Where I live this setup amounts to \\~1200EUR, though I have a feeling it may be an overkill for games like that and that I could further cheap out on the GPU and CPU - still thinking about it.""]"

Widow players are right to complain that sombra could counter her without much skill on the sombra’s part, and that’s more in line now. However, because of the strength and availability of widow’s grapple, combined with how uninteractable widow is with her range, the fact that sombra kept her from playing any spot she wanted, really fixed her for the rest of the game. And widow was still playable. Wisow was situational, even with a hard counter, she was still so good on some maps that you’d take the trade off every time(don’t lie widow players, you played her on circuit and that orher escort map everyone hates. Literally play her every time. Didn’t matter if there was a sombra). In truth, this is one of those necessary evil things. I actually really like playing sombra now and am having more fun than I have since ow 2 started, but the widow problem is going to be there until she gets reworked or you introduce another character who achieves basically the same effect as the sombra.', 'If you hate Sombra so much then you should be asking the devs to do something about Widow. A widow who can hit shots is uncounterable by anyone but another widow. Sombra is the only dps who can do something. In a straight 1v1 Sombra can shut down Widow but OW2 is not a 1v1 game. Anyone who has actually ever played Sombra and not just complained about her knows this. Playing against a half decent team the Widow will either have an Illari pylon above her 24/7. Or a Mercy attached to her. Or whatever other support utility that makes heroes unkillable. This idea that Sombra hard counters Widow is the most annoying myth I’ve ever seen in this game. Sombra is the one dps with the uptime available to keep that constant pressure on Widow. Even if you aren’t killing her you’re at least stopping her from playing kovaaks in the back of the map. I’ll stand by this forever that Widow is the worst designed hero in this game. It’s not that the one shot is inherently op. It’s that it is a risk free one shot that is always available. One shots should either have a big risk-reward associated with it or at least be on some sort of cooldown so it doesn’t randomly pop out of nowhere. Widow has neither of these which is why she’s is a cancer to this game. If you really want Sombra to be reworked then start with Widow. Because Sombra only exists to keep the real problem in check.', 'anytime i want to play widow theres either sombra or a better widow']"

Smolder's Q, even with the changes, still does more damage on a crit build than a lethality build.

W along did 100% AP scaling that then repeats 80% of said AP on repeated targets depending on however many people it hits.

AP Smolder could quite literally just delete teams if someone else forced them to clump together (Diana or Ori for example). But despite this, his Q suffered.

Due to such poor placement of the servers, the people residing in other corners of India( ESPECIALLY THE EAST CORNER OF INDIA) have very poor connection to the servers with ping averaging between 50-70 ms and even higher. For ex: I reside in Kolkata(which is on the east side) and get around 50ms, which makes rivals and champs a terrible experience.  My request to Ea is to please install new eafc data centers on the east coast( preferebly near Kolkata)! I guarantee this will be a profitable investment for Ea. Why? Cause with a population of 1.43 billion- there is a huge number of eafc players, pros, youtubers who suffer due to such poor connection. With the rapid growing eafc community in India, installing more data centers on the eastside will surely bring more profits.  Thank you.""]"

Shield bash cooldown is lowered from 5 to 3.5 seconds if brig does not bash an enemy Rally change: Double healing from inspire to brig during rally. These changes should help brig keep her healing up during fights due to more range as well as the increased duration which will allow brig to stay more safe using whipshot. She also would have more mobility and dmg from the charge mechanic which gives brig the choice to either deal more damage or escape and escape at a lower cooldown.

They take too long to go into the ground, and the burrow animation makes them incredibly vulnerable to being head shot. It just feels awful to know when to burrow but still die due to the animation taking so long and making you vulnerable during an ability that should be trying to protect you during the cast time. Venture also has no range, which i can perfectly accept. But if that’s the case why doesn’t Venture have 300 hp like Reaper and Mei? They have a bigger hitbox just like they do. They are similar and perform similar roles. 300 health would fix a lot of Venture’s issues. I hope you can take a look at them soon.', 'This is speaking strictly from a “playing against venture” stand point, and not a playing as Venture, but anyway… So far, not too miffed with Venture, but I do think the ‘burrow’ abilities cool down is too short.  Venture will pop out up out of the ground on you, and will almost always be able to get away whether it was a good engagement or not.  Combine that with the shield Venture receives and it hits a point where it’s like ""Why do I even try to fight you"" That’s about it so far.  I don’t have any feedback on the melee but I’ve seen some people saying it’s too much.', 'Personally i found that ventures kit is a bit more lame than presented for example you should be able to dig under meis ice wall i feel like a character whos thing is burrowing they should be able to get under places normal characters shouldnt So the dig feels very lame and unimpressive imo not only that but venture needs another ability most characters have 3 or more abilities venture only has the two movement abilities I guess they also have the melee boost which i love but a non mobile ability like a mine they put down or they put underground or something would be dope Addendum if two ventures are digging and you as venture use the drill boost it should damage the enemy venture underground i think also if you as venture use the melee attack it should damage an enemy venture that is burrowing in my opinion just as a fun thing I think these changes would make the character feel more reactive, fun, and fully realized <3']"

I have emailed a dispute but i'm worried this may not get overturned.\xa0  \xa0  Such a shame as there is clearly people on the market who are listing players to sell/buy coins but EA target people like myself who play the game legit and have never sold or bought coins.""]"

Since the nerf of the turret, Torb is just a filler, a hero filler.  Completely useless. I play Torb 99% of the time, and he’s completely trash. 1 million damage, and only 2 kills is how i can sum it. Blizz need to look into these flaws.', 'What is Torbs hero fantasy? I think part of it got lost with his rework back in OW1 and the rest was lost with OW2. His turret dramatically lacks complexity and is just SUPER boring imo. Right now his turret is just an annoyance to the enemy team rather than anything impactful or interesting gameplay wise. My suggestion: What if Torb gets all the PVE turrets? (Flame thrower, Ice thrower, Boop, and his current sniper turret) I would like to see his kit move slightly back to the builder or setup idea (not sitting there for 5 mins building a T2 turret just to be clear) How would it work?: Option A: Torb throws out a turret pack. It has no “head” attached yet. When he walks up he can interact and select a blueprint through a circle wheel. It takes two/three hits with the hammer to build up the turret. This would give his hammer an actual usecase. Option B: He presses shift, circle wheel pops up, you select the desired turret and then throw it out. This is ultimately a simpler version and would work better in OW2. This version would also allow for placing turrets on walls that you cant reach normally. All turrets have between 150 and 250hp and get 100hp overhealth for his E duration. What does this do?: It adds more depth to an otherwise really lacking kit. Just imagine a boop turret sitting behind the wall at the bridge in Liyang gardens. Or a flamethrower turret in combination with Mauga (oh god). Also a side note: His gun does not feel great to shoot atm. Idk if its the sound or the animation or both, it just feels unsatisfying. Edit: I am talking specifically about his hero fantasy as an engineer builder, not balance and not symmetra. Torb has no hero fantasy and dramatically lacks complexity specifically with the turret. If you hate the idea of Builders !IN A HERO SHOOTER!, maybe you should give apex a try.', 'These turret buffs are genuinly the worst. This combined with the lack of widow nerfs will destroy any fun you thought you where going to have this season. Torb turret does 13 damage a second. Has 250 hp and aplies the 25% dps passive, For 3 seconds now. Meaning that for example as lucio self healing being(“buffed” lucio healing except with the 25% passive the numbers are almost the same as pre buff)10 heals per second minus 25% from dps passive is either 7 or 8 healing per second[round up or down from 7.5] vs 13 dps that the turret does. Lucio does 88 damage per burst so he needs to hit three consecutive bursts to kill the turret. Im not saying that you will lose the 1v1 vs turret but the value turret now gets without any input from torb is crazy. Keep in mind this is without taking any outside factors into affect. When you add a 325 hp 75 armor torb(you heard me right. Torb pressing e has more hp then ow1 zarya) that can two shot you defending that turret and a widow that is being defended by that turret your chances of winning that encounter is zero to none. Also because of the faster deploy speed its harder to destroy turret outright. The fact we’re buffing torb turret in the midle of widow meta baffles me. If you want free wins right now lock in widow torb as that turret will mark any and all flank heroes whilst having more hp then all 225 heroes. Thats right a stationary aimbot hitscan turret has more hp then almost all flank heroes. Turret buffs need an immediate revert.']"

If you love chaos, explosions, and blaming your friends, this game\'s for you!', 'Are you tired of games that encourage teamwork, cooperation, and mutual respect? Look no further than HELLDIVERS 2, where chaos reigns supreme, and your best friend is your worst enemy. Strap on your exosuit, grab your trusty laser cannon, and get ready for a rollercoaster ride of hilarity, explosions, and accidental team wipes.\n\nPros:\nFriendly Fire Galore: In HELLDIVERS, friendly fire isn’t just a feature—it’s an art form. Nothing says “I care about you” like accidentally launching a rocket into your teammate’s face. Bonus points if they were mid-sentence, discussing their weekend plans.\nMission Briefings: The game’s mission briefings are like a game of telephone played by drunk space marines. “Secure the objective” becomes “steal the enemy’s coffee machine,” and “eliminate all threats” turns into “give the aliens a stern talking-to.” Good luck deciphering the actual mission goals!\nDiverse Enemies: From bug-like creatures to heavily armored cyborgs, HELLDIVERS offers a delightful variety of foes. But the real challenge? Identifying them during chaotic firefights. Is that a bug or your teammate? Who knows? Shoot first, ask questions later!\n\nCons:\nTeamwork: Who needs it? In HELLDIVERS 2, teamwork is overrated. Why coordinate attacks when you can accidentally drop a supply pod on your squadmate’s head? Remember, nothing says “team spirit” like a well-timed orbital strike on your own position.\nVoice Commands: The game’s voice commands are a comedy goldmine. “Requesting backup” becomes “singing ‘I Will Survive’ in Morse code,” and “need healing” turns into “performing interpretive dance.” It’s like playing charades with a malfunctioning AI.\nRespawns: Death is just a minor inconvenience in HELLDIVERS. Respawning is quick, but the real challenge is finding your gear after respawning. Pro tip: Check the nearest lava pit—it’s probably floating there, mocking your incompetence.\n\nConclusion\nHELLDIVERS 2 is the ultimate stress-reliever. Who needs meditation or yoga when you can accidentally blow up your entire squad and laugh about it? So grab your friends, embrace the chaos, and remember: In space, no one can hear you scream… unless you’re on voice chat.', 'Helldivers 2: Dive Harder - AKA the game where you and your pals can simultaneously save the galaxy and accidentally obliterate each other with poorly aimed airstrikes.\n\nPicture this: you and your squad, bravely facing off against hordes of extraterrestrial baddies, armed to the teeth with an arsenal that would make even Rambo blush. But wait, there\'s a catch! Friendly fire is not just a feature, it\'s an art form. Prepare to accidentally blast your best bud into orbit while trying to take down that giant space bug.\n\nHelldivers 2 takes teamwork to a whole new level. Forget about those games where you work together like a well-oiled machine. Here, it\'s more like a chaotic ballet of destruction, where communication is key, but so is having a good laugh when things inevitably go sideways.\n\nAnd the best part? The game doesn\'t just encourage you to scream ""Oops!"" when you accidentally drop a mech on your comrade\'s head, it practically demands it. So grab your friends, grab your weapons, and get ready for a hilarious, action-packed adventure that\'s equal parts epic and epically disastrous.\n\nJust remember: in space, no one can hear you scream... but they can definitely hear you laughing hysterically as you accidentally blow up your own team for the umpteenth time. 10/10 would friendly fire again.']"

Thanks for your patience. Original Post Hello Heroes, We’ve recently encountered an issue where new voice lines introduced in the current patch were not working correctly, causing them to be heard through an entire map regardless of proximity to other players. Because this causes a significant disruption in game play, we are disabling these voice lines until we can correct the issue in a future update. Because the Season 11 voice lines have been disabled, they have been removed from your equipped voice lines if you previously equipped them. You will be able to equip any other voice line released prior to the Season 11 patch as those are working correctly. These Season 11 voice lines will also temporarily no longer appear in the Season 11 Battle Pass track or in the list of voice lines in the Hero Gallery. Tiers where there is a voice line that is earned will not show any reward and will list “SKIN – UNSPECIFIED” as the reward. You do not earn a skin when completing any of these Battle Pass tiers , but you will be granted the voice line that normally appears in that tier once we resolve this issue. The following voice lines are earned in the following tiers in the Season 11 Battle Pass: Tier 3 - Third Most Final Form – Reinhardt Tier 14 - Not Good Enough – Kiriko Tier 22 – Level Up Dude – Baptiste Tier 26 – Final Boss – Doomfist Tier 33 – How Retro – Venture Tier 37 – Story’s Not Over – Cassidy Tier 42 – The True Battle – Zarya Tier 53 – No Style – Reaper Tier 66 – Silly Games – Symmetra Tier 73 – Green Ninja Cyborg Dude – Genji Tier 76 – Fate Decided – Hanzo Thank you for your understanding, and good luck as you progress through Season 11.']"

While the specific way in which publishers try to pry every last cent out of player hands has changed with the evolving technology of the industry, publishers are no more greedy today than they were in the days long since passed, it's just that the survivorship bias means you forget or gloss over all the bad memories because they're a lot more forgettable than great ones.\n\nIt's not true at all.\n\nI mean, yes obviously publishers where as greedy back then, but previously they thought maximising profits came up with making innovating games. Previously the biggest blockbusters were innovative games.\n\nDoom, Sim City, Half-Life, Gran Turismo, Mario 64... And of course, you had plenty of clones for those games, but still the dominating ones where innovators.\n\n2005-2010 was still a prolific time for original AAA games (Gear of War, Assassin's Creed, Mirror's Edge, Red Faction Guerilla, BF Bad Company, L4D...)\n\nI could still think of a few outliers for 2010-2015 (Dishonored, Titanfall 1, R6 Siege). I could slide Demon Souls/Dark Souls, it was clearly not AAA back then, but the sequels sure become big (and very stale...).\n\nThen in the last 10 years, the only example on an original big budget game I could think of would be Zelda Breath of the wild. (with an overused IP, but I'm not going to be too picky)\n\n>If you want original ideas, look at the indies and the like.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of indy are not innovative AT ALL. Just go on any store front and browse by release date and you're going to be drowned in a see of derivative clones.\n\nAnd for the few outliers... well there are small budget games, which is heavily limiting what they can do.\n\nI mean Balatro is cool (and not even that original to be honest, but whatever) but it's just a poker game with a slick UI."", ""Looking only at the games released after the start of this gen:  \nInscryption, Toem, Unpacking, Tunic, Sifu, Vampire Survivors, Not for Broadcast, Dredge, Jusant, Chants of Senaar, The Plucky Squire, Indika, Cocoon.\n\nIt's not difficult to find indie games that try something new and this list was only of the more popular games. Not all of them may be to your liking and I'm sure some here are sneering at Vampire Survivors or will say Tunic is just basically Zelda (which it isn't).\n\nPoint is I'm surprised the comment got downvoted. It's factual. There's much more innovation outside the AAA space and in the past there used to be more. In fact the post I replied to states this, partially, the fact that there used to be more innovation in AAA space.\n\nIt's only that they make the argument that inevitably this innovation should end. That means there was and now there's less. I'm making the argument that there's still plenty, just not in the AAA space, even though there used to be.\n\nEasiest way to look at this is for me to make a list of all the great indie games that are merely a rehash of games that created genres like Resident Evil or Symphony of the Night."", 'I would argue that innovation is largely overrated. At least, it\'s not as important as many gamers and devs seem to think. Many of the most popular and successful games are a matter of good execution without any major flaws. I mean, to *some* extent, good execution is a matter of innovation (Similar to how a factory might innovate to improve how it makes the same products as ever), but there\'s no rule stating that every great game *must* do something novel.\n\nPart of this perception, I think, is in how most players (and some critics) are bad at critiquing games. Criticism is often misplaced, misinterpreted, or even given in bad faith. The clearest example of this in action is the movie Lightyear. A truly terrible movie, which happened to have a gay kissing scene for all of two seconds. A few people pointed at that scene as an example of why the movie was terrible - but more importantly - fans of the movie used it as an excuse to dismiss any and all criticism. The movie has numerous problems, but there\'s a disconnect between why it sucks, and the reasons why people **say** it sucks.\n\nSo my theory, is that the criticism of ""unoriginality"", is almost always misplaced. Chances are the critic just didn\'t like it, but couldn\'t point to anything specific they felt was missing.\n\nIt\'s great when something is innovative and *improves* on old methods, but it\'s just as likely that the result is worse than simply using what works. If anything, innovation is usually a *net negative*; with most industry-wide improvements coming about when trends solidify on the best solution. The early days of computer games were marked by every game having its own arbitrary control scheme, and it frankly kind of sucked until they settled on the standards we have now. You have to **really** know what you\'re doing to improve on the standard']"

(This is admittedly an extreme example for 6 8-pin connector on a GPU)\n\nHOWEVER, that doesn’t excuse the shit melting dog poo 12V power connector that nVidea forces the PSU manufacturers into making. \n\nBut I also don’t know the full spec for the standard 8-pin and if it can handle the power draw which I do imagine it can, as I have yet to see any melting 8-pins', 'What do you mean by ""brand""? And brand of which component? And how do you prove which component created the failure? \n\nBear in mind that these failures are occurring in an environment where the PSU could be using a different brand CEM5 connector than the cable... and the cable could be using a different brand CEM5 connector than both the PSU and graphics card. \n\nHow could you possibly find out who is at fault there, particularly if the company at fault is a chinese manufacturing facility that supplied these faulty connector to, say, Asus? And then who is at fault? \n\nCertainly not nvidia, as they didn\'t design the connector. So would it be Amphenol and Molex who validated it? Because I\'m guessing they would have a REALLY easy time proving that said chinese-manufactured connector is out of spec. \n\nI mean, with reading about all the failures of this connector in this sub, you\'d think there\'d be tons of people lined up for a class action suit. Unless of course it\'s not as easy as going up against the entity who ""put their brand on the side"".', ""Actually each 8 pin connector on the GPU side is rated for 150W. The pigtail cable thus can do 300W and the PSU connector too. What I suspect happened is that the adapter makes it so the 3090 Ti cannnot balance (requires a 12VHPWR cable from the PSU) so the pigtail cable ended up being overloaded with way more than 300W which caused it to burn at the point that was least rated for that overload and prone to fail first which was the connector on the PSU.\n\nI also suspect the graphics card originally came with a warning not to use a pigtail connector with this adapter to avoid just this situation. It seems to me that such an adapter cannot with certainty avoid this risk if a pigtail connector is used.\n\nIt's all inherently flawed with 12VHPWR and adapters. If there had been 3 regular 8 pin connectors directly on the GPU then there would have been no issue with the pigtail and there is no reason to force 12VHPWR on cards that can make do with 3 regular 8 pin connectors instead. That way the card could have done the load balancing across its 3 connectors.\n\nThe 3090 Ti doing load balancing gets screwed when you have an adapter in between that connects everything to everything. You no longer have a separate path per 8 pin plug that you can balance across. You see 1 adapter and however the internal resistance of the wires comes out of the factory determines how equal the load will spread across the 3 8 pin plugs.""]"

It’s like the one nice thing that would last that came out of the Hell that is trying to play comp when Competitive Drives take effect. Either that or, idk, give me a good reward in comp points outside of Drive??? Drives made the rewards you get garbage during normal season play.

The 3x loss multiplier (was 5x multiplier) is a step in the right direction and the reduction of points needed for the maximum drives is great. I get why they keep that loss multiplier, however there is still one big problem with drives: End of season games have awful matchmaking. Not to mention that players are even more toxic and the community overall has been getting way more toxic in the last few months, which is a bad thing. It comes down to which team has more regular players vs casual players (don’t play a lot of ow, only play for the drives). Casual players often don’t perform at the rank they’ve been placed at earlier, which is part of why the matchmaking gets so bad. Whilst there are options to help with this, none of them really are good. Here’s some things that could be done: match an even amount of regular and casual players on each team: it should be pretty obvious that this would make queues longer and hard to implement quick rank decay: people would have trouble staying at a rank, so… “drives light”: a separate queue for casual players with slightly different rules to earn drives (e.g. points for every match you play, no point loss, but higher checkpoint marks needed): maybe possible, but kinda defeats drives as a concept ig?', 'Why have the competitive drive this weekend? Some people are away from their pc (myself included) to spend time with family and what not due to the holiday. I was looking forward to the drives since I want comp points, but it seems I won’t be able to this season. On one hand, some people will have Black Friday off work, so they will be available. However, plenty of people travel as well. I also heard the drives are even more of a grind than last time, which is unfortunate. Drives could at least last a week.']"

I wanted to share a dream I have for Apex Legends, which I believe would significantly improve the gaming experience for many players.  My dream is to see a comprehensive kill tracker implemented for the mixtape mode, encompassing Control, Gun Run, and Team Deathmatch. As someone who predominantly plays mixtape and rarely ventures into Battle Royale, I find it challenging to enjoy the game to its fullest without a dedicated tracker for mixtape kills.  Having spent a considerable amount of time—1032 hours to be exact—playing Apex Legends, I used to primarily engage in Arena mode, where I achieved significant damage and kill counts. Unfortunately, Arena mode was replaced by mixtape, which lacks trackers. Consequently, I now accumulate numerous kills in a single match, such as 19 kills in one game, without a way to track my overall performance in mixtape.  Because of the absence of a mixtape kill tracker, I currently use a Battle Royale tracker, which often disappoints me with its low kill count due to my limited playtime in Battle Royale. My passion lies in mixtape, where I spend most of my time in Apex Legends.  I sincerely hope that my dream of having a mixtape kill tracker becomes a reality, as it would greatly enhance my gaming experience and that of many others who share my preferences.  Thank you for considering my suggestion.  Best regards ,"", 'I am probably not the only one on here that feels like this, but mixtape is not fun anymore. There is impossible to take a single fight because people are running around, locked to the hip of their squadmates instead of just fighting. I know Apex is a team based game, but shouldn\'t you use Mixtape as a way to just have fun and get better at fighting? since it has no impact on your stats? They should really put a matchmaking into mixtape that match you based on playstyle rather than some arbitrary ""skill"" level. That way, those that are running around fighting 3 or even 4v1 meet similar players and can do that all they want. and those of us that are just playing mixtape for fun can just have fun instead of wanting to uninstall life every game', 'Ever since the mixtape was implemented, the method has been to switch modes every 15 minutes, but I think it should be changed so that each mode can be selected and played as and when desired.  Here is why I think this  ・There is currently too little content to play in Apex (pubs or ranked matches or mixtape mode at that time of day).  ・Currently (as of season 21) there are 4 mixtape modes, so if you only want to play a specific mode you like, you have to wait up to 45 minutes after playing 1-2 matches to play the next mode.  ・Mixtape mode is supposed to be a great way to take a break from Battle Royale mode (pubs or ranked matches) or when you feel like taking a break from Battle Royale gameplay, but the fact that you are forced to play specific modes at different times of the day makes it a stressful experience. However, the fact that you are forced to play certain modes at certain times of the day does not allow you to relax, but instead stresses you out and can lead you to leave the apex itself.  In particular, I think it is a bit too little, especially after so much time has passed since its release, that there are only three playable content options to choose from in each time zone, and only two if you consider Battle Royale mode or otherwise.  So, in order to increase the amount of content that can be played at each time slot as much as possible, the mixtape mode should allow users to freely choose the mode of their choice at any time they want, instead of switching modes every 15 minutes as it is now.']"

The screenshots are in German, but I think they're easy to understand with my description and the markings.\n1) If I have the same spell in two different classes, in the screenshot Longstrider. Of course, I only assign it to one spell slot. However, it still shows me that I could also cast it in the other class, but I can't right now because there are no free spell slots. I don't find this very helpful, and it's just annoying.\n \n \n2) For spells, the attribute of the class I start with is displayed in the lower right corner. But if I want to cast the same spell with a class other than the first class, nothing is displayed there. \nThe screenshot shows the spell Ice Knife. For my character as a druid, it says Wisdom, and for Gale, it says Intelligence. But when Gale wants to cast the spell as a druid, nothing is displayed there.\n \n \nThis is well solved for spell tricks that come from different classes. In the screenshot, Shadowheart has the spell Fire Bolt and can cast it with either Intelligence or Charisma.\n3) Spells can no longer be learned by wizards in their class if they already know the spell in another class. In the screenshot, Gale has the spell Charm Person as a druid, but as a wizard he does not have it and cannot learn it anymore. Why? This limits how he can assign his spell slots.

It\'s Starship Troopers meets a vending machine that only dispenses live ammunition and catastrophic friendly fire.\n\nLet’s start with the plot: You are a proud Helldiver, sworn to spread Managed Democracy™ across the galaxy—whether the galaxy likes it or not. Picture Space America with less diplomacy and more orbital bombardments. Every mission feels like a goodwill tour hosted by a Molotov cocktail.\n\nGameplay? Oh, it\'s “tactical.” And by tactical, we mean it requires the delicate coordination of four players screaming at each other as one of them accidentally calls down an airstrike on the squad because they input “left-down-up-right” instead of “left-down-up-down.” There is no ""I"" in team, but there *is* an “I” in “I just killed us all with a resupply pod.”\n\nEnemies? Oh, they\'re there. Bug swarms, automatons, and the occasional super-powered monstrosity that clearly skipped balancing in the dev meeting. But don’t worry—you have a robust arsenal of guns, grenades, mechs, and the ultimate weapon: pure, unfiltered chaos.\n\nThe community is something special too. Nothing says camaraderie like someone reviving you only to immediately launch you off a cliff with a recoilless rifle “on accident.” Every session is a team-building exercise designed by the military-industrial complex and a band of caffeinated raccoons.\n\nHelldivers 2 isn’t just a game—it’s an experience. A beautiful, explosive mess where liberty is measured in bullets, and your biggest enemy is the guy on your own squad who “thought he was throwing a smoke grenade.” 5 stars. 2 brain cells. 1 nation under Super Earth.\n\nDEMOCRACY DELIVERED.\n(And possibly exploded.)\n\n\n']"

At the end of the day, neither Joel nor Marlene cared what Ellie wanted. \n\nJoel tested the waters earlier that day- ""We don\'t have to do this. You know that, right?"" to which she responded, ""What\'s the other option? [...] It can\'t be for nothing."" He doesn\'t want to give her a choice because he ""knows"" she will choose to sacrifice herself, feeling that it\'s the only path forward, when he wants her to live.\n\nMarlene keeps the truth from Ellie by sedating her before she comes to from her near-drowning, and I honestly believe she would also have lied to her if she was awake. However righteous the Fireflies\' motivation was at the end of the day, Marlene was set on that path. She herself already struggled with the decision to kill Ellie in the search for a cure, because of the promises made to Ellie\'s mother and her attachment to Ellie herself and just in general the *killing of a child*. She ""knows"" that Ellie wouldn\'t want to die- who would? And by denying her that decision, Marlene is able to hide from the guilt and go through with it.\n\nWhat would Ellie herself have wanted in that position if given the choice? I don\'t think even she knows, genuinely. She\'s shown to be mad that Joel took the decision away from her, but at the same time I think she underestimates how heavy and unfair it would have been to put that choice on the shoulders of a fourteen/fifteen year-old girl. It\'s easy for her to say, safely out of reach of the consequences, that she would sacrifice herself. Maybe she\'s scared that she would make the ""wrong"" decision and choose herself.\n\nThere isn\'t a ""right"" decision; there isn\'t a clean ""what if"" scenario. The Fireflies aren\'t even sure that by killing Ellie they\'d be able to make a cure. That struggle and that uncertainty is why the ending is so impactful.', 'Exactly. Further, there were so many opportunities for people to just talk to each other >!or not threaten Joel/Ellie\'s lives. All that doc at the end had to do was not try and stab Joel and he\'d still be alive. Then a dialog could have happened that could have involved Ellie having agency in all this.!<\n\n>!Then we are supposed to feel like Ellie and Abby are on the same moral level. Abby actively sought out and killed Joel. Ellie killed that pregnant friend of Abby in self defense, she would have let them go had they not gone for her. It just made the whole ""they are the same"" narrative not work for me at all.!<', 'This isnt how I read the ending of the first at all. The entire game. And I mean the \\*\\*entire\\*\\* game, is setting up Ellie essentially becoming Joels new daughter. The game starts with him tragically losing Sarah, making him closed off. Over the course of the game, you as well as Joel, bond with Ellie. Everything is setting up the final act. The final decision by joel to sacrifice everything to save Ellie, his daughter.\n\nHe lost his daughter once and by the end of the game he refuses to go through that again. Nothing else matters. Ellie is the only thing that matters. Ignoring the fact that the cure isnt even guaranteed, it doesnt matter to Joel. He\'d be willing to doom the world if it means saving Ellie. I think its a powerful revelation of fatherhood and what a father is willing to go through to save their daughter. Even murder. Even holding back a potential cure to a disease. Nothing is off the table. Ellie has to survive. And I think the game earned that ending because the entire game is clearly building to it.\n\nThe last sequence directly parallels the first. But where you lost Sarah in the first, you get to save Ellie in the second. I wouldnt use the words ""won"", but it definitely gives me the feeling of victory. As a father. You saved her. I had the same emotional response to saving Ellie that joel did and Im not even a father. I couldnt imagine what it would be if I actually had kids irl. Im saving Ellie no matter what. It wouldnt make sense for Joel to do anything else. I wasnt conflicted in my decision to save Ellie and neither was Joel. And I dont think the player is suppose to be.\n\nIm surprised so many people had the altruistic mindset where they disagreed morally with the decision. That they thought killing ellie for a maybe cure was somehow morally correct from the fathers perspective. Id never let my daughter die for something like that.']"

The voices in their head slowly gained their trust, convincing them that the king must be stopped.  They went to the throne room fully behind Dain, however The Vinster King was already fully corrupted by the Abyss, so when they got to the king, the Abyssal corruption that was slowly creeping into the 5 sinners took complete hold as they came face to face with the source.  Rerir was finally convinced that what he was doing for the king was wrong and wanted to save Tholindis, she misunderstood his intentions when confronting Rerir and jumped into the portal, at this point the Abyss's influence took complete hold as he went to the throne room."", 'My interpretation of that scene was that Ved\'s foresight came back because the moment Rerir showed up to let him out, everyone\'s fates as ""Sinners"" were sealed. Because the Abyss could speak to them, I wouldn\'t consider it too out of the ordinary for it to be able to do some mind tricks or show visions to people already predisposed to it.\n\nVed told Rerir he believed he just ""saw something new"" when Rerir arrived, and then he\'s able to predict that Rerir\'s going to the Universitas would lead him back to the king\'s throne room. His last words are ""we\'ll be seeing each other again not so soon,"" and when Rerir comes back, Rhinedottir says, ""You made it"" or something, indicating that the others were expecting him to return and claim the power, too. I don\'t believe Ved could see Rerir with a dagger in that very moment, but instead, I think he saw him using the dagger in a vision of the near future.', 'Yeah i agree, seeing people first reaction to the atrocities commited by Rerir in detail. They immediately jumped the gun on rerir being the worst of the sinner despite in term of scale Rhinedottor and Surtalogi most definitely have higher body count. But since their methods are more fantastical and not relatable to irl a lot of ppl fall to their bias (which is totally fine ppl will always have bias). \n\nWhat i disagree with is when ppl claim they will have the moral high ground IF they were in Rerir position, that they will do the right thing if they were rerir. Ofc Not justifying his action tho (idk why ppl keep needing to say this when both understanding a character and disagreeing with them can coexist) \n\nAlso Idk where this dain didnt know anything came from but Dain at the very least knew Rerir was an assassin, from the info nefer said when she enter rerir past and when dain told us about rerir intelect and how he is effective and calculated at locating and pursuing his target.']"

Which community? Here, the forums? Do Blizzard devs actually pay attention to the sentiment here and respond accordingly?  All threads?  Only from whales?  Only new players?  They would have the data to know who is saying what, and how many hours they have on Genji for example.  Do they actually do this or are the forums just a black hole of wailing? Do they mean only pro-players?  Do they mean notable content creators? Twitch streamers? Uh, whoever has the most charisma and loudest voice in terms of followers?  Are we all just tagging along for the ride as Flats (and the rest) determine the game for us? Is Blizzard sending out surveys about patch changes or some other structured means of acquiring feedback?  Who has gotten one of these?  Is there a suggestion box of some kind that we all should be using instead of just venting on forums?  When has Blizzard ever demonstrably asked for feedback, provided a means for the playerbase to give it, and then  made changes on the data received? Has it ever happened? Just as an example, Sym has been reworked to death and is questionably viable - almost to the point where it seems like Blizz has no vision for the character and what people like about playing her and against her.  But they have the data to know who has 1000 hours on Sym, they know who the Sym mains are and could ask them - but do they?  Whenever changes are made to any character, how do the devs seek out, acquire and acknowledge this “feedback” they talk about so much about? Should we all be hollering over in the various subreddits? Okay well which ones?  Or dropping our comments into KarQ’s youtube comments?  Where is this “community” that they are talking about, because I feel completely walled off by the devs from giving any feedback that might be considered, even a little bit, about anything.  Yet they consistently lead all their announcements of fundamental changes to “community feedback”, which increasingly seems disingenuous… Unless I’m just missing something, and there’s been a suggestion box attached to the Route 66 payload this whole time.', 'We should let the forums Balance the game!', 'Even the forums are dead.

Tossing the drone out ahead of a fight is not even a little helpful because the camera is pointed at the sky and you don't get a scan. Piloting the drone, adjusting the camera downwards, then exiting the drone takes like 6 seconds.  \xa0  In the previous Crypto rework, the drone looks 180 degrees if the cursor is green and you're throwing the drone at a wall, and the drone looks horizontally if you throw it at the ground. There really should be a mirrored perspective at the angle you throw it at such that:   Thrown straight out or below horizontal = drone looks straight out  Thrown straight up = drone looks straight down  Thrown at 30 deg angle up = drone looks down at 30 deg angle  Thrown at 60 deg angle up = drone looks down at 60 deg angle   Or imagine a way to adjust angle without entering drone by holding the tactical and moving your mouse / thumbstick. They could re-do the deployment by:   single tactical tap = throw drone  double tactical tap = throw and enter drone view  hold tactical (drone stowed) = double tap  hold tactical (drone already out) + move mouse = adjust angle"", ""So my idea is based on past feedback/ideas, which is to switch the Tactical and Ultimate.

Players can tap their tactical twice to use two charges to give it a larger AoE.\xa0  - Doesn't slow enemies and Crypto isn't affected by his own EMP\xa0  [=] Ultimate - Surveillance Drone  - (Moved) Neurolink is now inherent on his ultimate.\xa0  - No longer takes Ring damage  - Drone Cooldown is 30 seconds  Level 2 Perks:  - (NEW) Marked: Crypto can scan deathboxes to track the surviving attackers\xa0  - Off the Grid: Cloaked while controlling Surveillance Drone  Level 3 Perks:  - Idea #1 - Network Expansion: +25% range on Drone scans  - OR  - Idea #2 - Knocking an enemy reduces Tactical cooldown and Finishing an enemy restores a Tactical charge  - Satellite Imagery: Enemies stay revealed for 1.5 seconds even after leaving scan radius or getting hit by EMP Grenade / Drone EMP"", ""My old post i regularly updated throughout the years has mysteriously dissapeared after hitting submit a few minutes ago.\xa0  8x master 4k dmg player.

Off the grid should be applicable even if he is not using the drone. So maybe non drone mode he can't be scanned and drone mode he has a very weak invisibility to make a play for banners, quick scouting, rotation scouting, emp play.  QoL: allow drone to have a white circle to determine emp radius placement.  Allow crypto to recall drone while rezzing.  Enemy emp is red not blue.  BUFF: nuero-lens - smart contact lenses that allow crypto to scan legends in view 15-20m away for him and team. Does not need drone for this. Persist 1.5 seconds out of line of sight.  Crypto can hack ultimate accelerants instantly. Can use ring beacons as the info expert he is. Can hack deathboxes for banners with his tech wrist gear.\xa0\xa0  Crypto can use a emp grenade as ultimate replacement when drone is gone. If one has heirloom he throws the sword.  Crypto can glide with his drone also :D  Crypto doesn't stun himself or team with emp. Or hurt himself.""]"

Link to old thread: https://forums.ea.com/discussions/fc-26-general-discussion-en/clarification-on-fc-26-ultimate-edition-pre-order-rewards-amazon-purchase/12548905  I pre-ordered EA SPORTS FC 26 Ultimate Edition via Amazon before the Aug 26, 2025 deadline. The product page listed the standard Ultimate Edition rewards (ICON Player Item, additional Evolution slot, Season 1 Premium Pass, FC Points, etc.).  I’ve carefully reviewed EA’s own FC 26 disclaimers and terms, which state:   The Ultimate Edition pre-order offer expires Aug 26, 2025 at 9:00pm PT.  Redemption deadlines extend well into 2026 (e.g. Sept 26, 2026 for pre-order content, June 15, 2026 for FC Points).  Nothing clearly says the game/code must be redeemed by Aug 26 — only that the pre-order itself must be placed by then.   However, in my last thread an EA representative pointed me toward a stipulation buried inside a PC-focused article, hidden within collapsible content. This wasn’t obvious at all, and it raises the question: how are console players supposed to find and interpret conditions that affect their eligibility when they’re tucked away in PC documentation?  My concern: Since Amazon hasn’t issued codes yet, how does EA verify that players who pre-ordered before Aug 26 are eligible for the ICON and Evolution slot rewards? Does EA take the Amazon order date as proof, or will players lose out simply because of delays in retailer distribution and misleading advertisement?  Questions:   Can EA confirm that Amazon is considered a “participating retailer” for Ultimate Edition pre-orders on console (as in previous years)?  If a customer ordered before Aug 26 but redeems later, will they still receive the ICON + Evo slot?   I’ve read all the terms and disclaimers available on EA.com, and I can’t find anything that clearly contradicts my understanding — yet the hidden stipulation has caused confusion.  Please could this be escalated or clarified properly? Players need confidence that pre-ordering through Amazon still secures the advertised rewards.  Thanks for your time,', 'When EA FC 24 release I bought ultimate edition and then I opened them when I was able to. Today, I bought the EA FC Play Pro for 16.99 eur, and when I went to EA FC 24 Ultimate Team, I received 3 packs, the same packs that u get from the EA FC 24 Preorder. My question is, will I get the EA FC 25 Preorder rewards or is it bugged and I got the wrong ones?  Thank you.']"

Recently, I picked it up again on PC and was having a great time....until I got the corvette. That’s where everything went wrong.\n\nHere’s what happens when you try to use the corvette:\n\n> Enter a space station? Nope, it clips through walls.\n> Enter the anomaly? Same thing, flies right through em walls.\n> Try a mission? Nope, giant storage objects blocks my view.\n> Land on a frigate to repair? Nope, just sails past the landing point.\n> Finish a mission and return to the anomaly? Nope, the whole game crashes.\n\n(surely these would have been discovered through the testing stage? They\'re very obvious and repetitive)\n\nMost of these bugs trigger with the dreaded ""I\'m in combat"" message. Once that pops up, you\'re sweating hard and just hoping your last save bails you out. You\'re completely stuck unless you have an emergency warp, which I don\'t because I hoard resources and money/credits for no real reason (Just like real life <3).\n\nWithout the corvette, the game is solid and fun, but since I really want to use the corvette and it\'s basically unplayable, I can\'t recommend it at this time.

Thanks.\r\n\r\nI take my corvette to my frigate and dock it. Everything seems normal until I warp back onto it and try to fly away. My corvette is clipped inside the frigate and I cannot get it dislodged. After multiple attempts, reloading saves, restarting the game, I eventually manage to fix it by jumping out into space, flying a little ways away, and re-summoning it.\r\n\r\nJust now, I warp back to a previous base. The game teleports the corvette onto the roof with me helplessly trapped inside it. Can't escape. Reload the save, try again, same thing happens. Apparently I cannot warp to this base as long as I have the corvette.\r\n\r\nGetting the corvette has been a huge mistake.

You should look at the concurrent players for OG Oblivion and Starfield from before Oblivion Remaster released. I would bet money that the remaster has brought a ton of people back to the original. Plus, Starfield is at this point a pretty old game by those standards, you can't really look at concurrent players now as a good metric for anything. If you really want to make a fair comparison, you'd look at concurrent players at their peak for all three, Starfield, Oblivion, and Oblivion Remaster. I don't know those numbers, but that would be a lot more fair."", 'To me it just further reinforces the notion that the\xa0quality of a game doesn\'t matter at all in how it\'s received, all that really matters is narrative and public perception. Starfield was doomed before it even released simply because it\'s not TES 6. Bethesda shot themselves in the foot by going so many years without a new TES game that it literally didn\'t matter what they did, Starfield was going to be negatively received no matter how good or bad the game was. Personally I thought Starfield was quite decent and a massive improvement in quality over anything Bethesda has done since Morrowind, yet the narrative around the game from the beginning was negative because it wasn\'t TES 6.\nMeanwhile Cyberpunk and No Man\'s Sky are now loved by everyone because the developers managed to turn the narrative around, even though the core game design issues everyone complained about on the release of those games are still more or less unchanged.\n\n\nBethesda are master hype builders, in my opinion the best in the industry, and it\'s the #1 reason Oblivion and Skyrim were so well received even though they are such mediocre games. There\'s an incredibly interesting article on Fallout NMA about Bethesda\'s scummy marketing campaign for Oblivion called ""Don\'t Buy The Hype"" if you care to read it. This Oblivion Remastered shadowdrop was not a shadowdrop at all, Bethesda was 100% behind all those fake ""leaks"" to build hype. They made it look like they\'re doing everyone a favor remastering Oblivion\'s hype train experience that every Xbox 360 kiddie got sucked into when they were 12 years old.\xa0\n\n\nWill it last? No. Oblivion is an extremely mediocre game and even less of an Elder Scrolls than Skyrim. It had no staying power on release and it will have no staying power now either. It\'s the only pre-Fallout 4 Bethesda game that never got a fanmade remake or remaster and also the modding scene was completely dead compared to Morrowind and Skyrim. Once the hype for the remaster dies down it will be forgotten again, but Bethesda doesn\'t care because they got their money almost for free with this new type of dishonest shadow marketing that was the Oblivion Remaster ""leaks"".', 'I currently have 50 hours of playtime in Oblivion Remastered right now, and I\'m loving it. There are certainly critiques to be made about how Oblivion simplified some of the roleplaying mechanics from Morrowind, but as an avid Skyrim player, I think Oblivion strikes a good balance between character-building depth and simplicity. I think Skyrim went too far in removing mechanics like character attributes and spell-crafting. I\'m hoping that BGS takes the negative feedback from Starfield and the positive feedback from Oblivion Remastered to heart. I would love for them to reverse course on their ""streamlining"" trend and return to the character-building depth that is present in Oblivion.\n\nThere are some things that I love more about Skyrim than Oblivion, however, and I really want for them to keep or deepen these in the next TES installment. I love how every dungeon in Skyrim has a little story to tell. You\'ll find notes and communications from bandits, or you might skeletons and corpses that are used for environmental storytelling. While this is sometimes present in Oblivion\'s Ayleid ruins, the frequency of environmental storytelling just isn\'t as consistent as in Skyrim. I also am not a fan of the enchanting system in Oblivion as it is far too restrictive. I would love for TES VI to take the best of these two games and combine them together rather than streamlining them as they did from Morrowind to Oblivion and from Oblivion to Skyrim. \n\nDo you guys think the success of Oblivion Remastered on Steam and Gamepass will push Bethesda to adopt more in-depth roleplaying mechanics? One hurdle I do acknowledge is that TES VI may already be deep in development at this point, so it might be too late to implement the feedback obtained from Starfield and Oblivion Remastered.']"

Bad. I've been playing it on and off for about a year and can never seem to leave the first area (I haven't even beat Grisha yet). I'm not new to Souls games and soulslikes, just new to Mortal Shell, and have no idea what the hell I'm doing. Any suggestions as to best shell, or even what the hell to do are greatly appreciated.\n\nI also wanna note that I currently have Harros and I just unlocked Solomon."", 'A Nearly There Souls-like: Close, but Not Close Enough\n\nAs an avid fan of Souls-like games, I approached Mortal Shell with optimism. However, my journey through this game left me with mixed feelings, as it only manages to grasp a handful of ideas that make the Souls series so compelling.\n\nThe combat is undoubtedly the most crucial aspect. The restriction of only being able to block once every 5 seconds adds an intriguing layer of difficulty, forcing players to rely more on evasion and timing rather than relying solely on blocking. But every boss strategy quickly turns into Running attack, Harden, Attack, Attack, Roll Away. Repeat. As the game progressed, it became increasingly frustrating and detracted from the overall enjoyment.\n\nIn a genre known for its diverse builds and arsenal of weapons, spells, and abilities, Mortal Shell falls short with only four different weapons and three distinct builds. The fast, stamina-heavy character; the slow, high-health character; and the well-rounded character. The lack of variety severely limits player choice and stifles creativity in character building. \n\nCustomization is a fundamental aspect of the Souls experience. By the time I complete the first dungeon, I had already unlocked all the perks for my character and had nothing to spend my plethora of Tar on. This robs players of a satisfying sense of progression, resulting in a less engaging experience overall.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, Mortal Shell does have its moments of brilliance. The combat, while flawed, still retains the weighty, deliberate feel that Souls fans love, and the world design is suitably atmospheric and immersive. The bosses were awesome despite only being three of them. \n\nIn conclusion, I give Mortal Shell six Dark Souls Bonfire out of ten. It is a Souls-like game that shows promise but ultimately falls short of its potential. With some adjustments and refinements, the Devs could evolve Mortal Shell 2 into a truly outstanding addition to the genre.', ""I genuinely want to love this game, but mortal shell  is by far the worst Soulslike game I've played""]"

I think the worst thing you can do is go into this with the expectation of it being exactly like Megaman. Mighty No. 9 isn't the Megaman 1:1 people wanted, it's more like an indie team took a crack at it. People also thought Keiji was going to have a more direct role in its development but Keiji worked for a company that pitches games and commissions others to make them. His job was only to handle design. Inti that made Megaman Zero made this one. Personally, I like this quite a bit. It looks like megaman, sounds like megaman, has the best voice acting (Matt Mercer, Yuri Lowenthal, and Steve Blum), and has good tight controls. \n\nPlay through the game once with lives set to 9. Learn the game first, then run it again with less lives. This is one of those games where it doesn't click immediately. I had the most fun on runs immediately after getting a game over and running the stage again. I think if you go in with no expectations you'll find a good fun game. Don't expect a 10, but a high 6 or 7. Call's stage sucks though, genuinely atrocious."", 'This game gets a bit of an unfair reputation as a bad Megaman game made by the ""father of Megaman."" A lot of the critism for how the post kickstarter era of this game was handled. The community manager stuff, the multiple delays, the degrade in graphics quality compared to the inital pitch (probably the biggest sin of this game.), the partnering with Deepsilver after already having hit such a high mark on kickstarter, unfufilled promises (3DS&Vita versions rip). The weird marketing, we all remeber: ""Cry like an anime fan on prom night.""  I would know all of this, i was an original backer. I\'ve played this game on PS3, Wii U, and PC. So my total time is definitely a little higher than on here. \n\nI\'m not going to say that Mighty No. 9 is some overlooked gem of a Megaman game that people wrote off, because of the aforementioned issues. If not for all of the issues i stated, on top of this game not being able tonlive up to being the successor to Megaman we all needed (Especially in a time were Megaman ganes were far and few. (Hey look at that, Capcom hasn\'t made a new Megaman game in quite a while...deja vu.)\n\nI think this game would just be remebered as a mediocre Megaman clone. Not great, but not horrible. The game can be fun, thr controls and combat functions and feels satisfying to play. MN9 even has a few unique ideas w8th the dashing through weakened enemies to kill them and get power ups. Thats neat. \n\nBut the story and world is lacking, even compared to some of the weakest Megaman games. Its bland and generic. The voice acting is not great either, and not even in a so bad its good like Megaman 8 or X4. \n\nIf it were possible i would give this game a rankking between recommend and not recommend. If you don\'t have the patience to put up with a decent clone of a game you like thay doesn\'t do much to live up to its inspiration, avoid this game. But if you\'re looking for something to scratch that Megaman itch, and you haven\'t tried this game i would recommend it, because it can be fun. Though I\'d say get it on a sale if possible.']"

Don't get me wrong as I liked the Remuria music, and a few Fontaine overworld tracks have grown over me, but the previous two weekly boss music just wasn't it. I'm not a fan of it as it wasn't really something that you can vividly remember by say, humming the theme. It just wasn't as memorable compared to some amazing tracks like Scara or Signora's theme. \n\nThe current tracks had something in them that I find lacking, idk how to fully explain it... but like they don't evoke something to make me care about why it's written the way it is. For me, boss battle music portrays not only a medium to make the players feel hyped, but also to tell a story about the person/enemy/thing that you're fighting. I got little to none of that feeling with the Narwhal and especially Arlecchino which I was SO looking forward to back then. Everything's been drowned in jarring parts like dubstep, when it doesn't really fit the moment and it's disappointing really..\n\nWith regards to the overall Fontaine music, I'd say that there's somehow a lack of coherence compared to Sumeru and Inazuma when you can tell that the tracks are different, but still consistent enough that it doesn't feel out of place when placed alongside the other tracks. I'm now really hoping that they can step up further with Natlan music the way that YPC really elevated the standard of GI music."", 'I feel like it lost that ""something special"". It\'s still good, but doesn\'t feel as unique (?) anymore. Not sure how to describe it but it feels more ""normal"" now. When I think of past themes like signora\'s (which combined opera with electric guitar), or Fischl\'s GAA domain theme (which felt so whimsical, and then you suddenly get the guitar part), or azhdaha\'s theme (which combined classical/traditional instruments with electronic music), or Raiden\'s boss theme (which has that part where the musical feels like it jumps from the left ear to the right, and that one part with the pause in the music), Genshin\'s music felt incredibly unique to me. \n\nThere are still some amazing pieces of music in Fontaine. Vaguelette is fantastic for example, I love the fairy tale music that plays in the world quest, or even just Fontaine\'s music theme. But they all just feel ""not as special"" for some reason. It could be because I\'m more used to European music than to traditional Japanese or Chinese. But stuff like Fischl\'s GAA domain or scara\'s Boss Battle are not Japanese or Chinese, so I don\'t know. I\'ll see when Natlan comes out.\n\nFor some reason the weekly boss themes (narwhal and signora) are much less memorable to me than the rest. And I mean significantly. I couldn\'t even hum the melody if someone asked me. I couldn\'t tell you why. It\'s true I don\'t particularly like dubstep, but it never bothered me in Yu-Peng Chen\'s music, I always loved that one. The only thing I remember about the narwhal theme is the part where you\'re swallowed and the music is distorted. Arlecchino has only been out for a month and a half but still I only now noticed that it has some nice opera singing. \n\nI don\'t know, I really can\'t explain it other than ""Yu-Peng Chen\'s music had something special"". But again I\'m not saying the music now is bad by any means. La Vaguelette is one of my favorite moments in genshin, rivaling even The Divine Damsel of Devastation"".', ""I don't think the new music is bad, I love Fontaine underwater for example. But it's definitely not the same, and yes I did feel the change since sumeru. Not in terms of quality, but the overworld music lacks the continuity, the consistency, the coherence early regions had. I feel like before the music had a crescendo about them, like they built on top of each other region after region if that makes sense, and then since he left it feels more like I'm listening to a automated playlist on random/shuffle. Also, emotion, his songs can put me to tears by just entering an area, or listening to it over the quests, i find myself stopping whatever I'm doing in game just to listen to it, and I never felt that anymore, they had a nostalgic quality to them that was very special.\n\nFor Fontaine, I liked the underwater music and la vaguelette, and some tracks here and there for the overworld but nothing that had the same appeal. I used to look forward to the battle themes when they released, and I've played the orchestra video for mondstadt, liyue and inazuma a thousand times, i never did it for fontaine, it's not memorable at all to me. Also while I am a largely EDM/Dance music fan, i never liked the way hoyo used it in honkai impact, and I genuinely dislike seeing it being transferred to genshin. Although I did like the music in the natlan teaser so I guess that can be redeemed.""]"

Remember there\'s very little difference between ""realtime destructible"" and ""realtime editable"". Unreal is designed heavily for hand-authored immutable levels, The Sims is the opposite of that, it\'s entirely dynamic.\n\nAnd it\'s *full* of dynamic entities. Unreal does not handle those well.\n\n> especially since The Sims has always gone for the cartoony/lo-fi style which is less computationally expensive.\n\nThe Sims isn\'t painful in terms of pixel shader or vertex shader, it\'s painful in terms of draw call optimization and, I suspect more importantly, CPU.\n\n> There\'s certainly a lot of game logic work going into something like The Sims but it\'s the sort that would be largely the same regardless of engine choice\n\nThe point I\'m making is not that Unreal is peculiarly bad for The Sims, it\'s that there\'s no solid engine that\'s really good for The Sims. At this point pretty much every engine is based on a very similar set of bones; mostly static levels, offline baking for optimization, relatively few dynamic entities, big hierarchical scenegraph, relatively simple game logic. And yes, The Sims has a *lot* of game logic work. That\'s the problem; most people/studios are not set up to handle that kind of load. It\'s a different kind of load than what people have sorta settled on as the standard.\n\n> Also on your point about core gamer target stuff, I think you\'re making a sweeping generalisation based on your own experience as a gamer/dev. There is no shortage of management/life sims out there and obviously there are developers who enjoy that genre of game, or else there wouldn\'t be so many games in that category.\n\nI mean, anything talking about trends on this scale is going to be a generalization, yes.\n\nBut unless you\'re disagreeing with the OP\'s fundamental point, that there aren\'t many Sims-likes out there, then I would argue that, no, there actually aren\'t that many life sims out there.', 'Weren\'t there, at one time, a slew of various small indie Minecraft-esque games? Probably no so much anymore, but I remember that being considered an oversaturated genre maybe a decade or so ago.\n\nTbh, I think the prospect of competing with 10+ years of various DLC is likely very intimidating to would-be developers of a Simslike. That, and the complexity level of that kind of game, are what I\'m thinking are the biggest factors in why The Sims hasn\'t yet had a true competitor the way that Cities Skylines competes with SimCity. \n\nYou\'d have to compete by having very strong gameplay fundamentals right out of the gate, probably also with a planned out roadmap for some forthcoming DLC over the next couple of years that would further flesh it out. \n\nI\'m super interested to see how Paralives does. Assuming I find a job by that time and all that, I\'ll gladly pay for early access to check it out. (With the understanding that it\'s early access, and reasonable expectations in light of that.) \n\nAnother factor in The Sims 4 sucking in many ways, is that 2 and 3 are still popular. (2, along with 1, was basically abandonware until recently, when EA did a rerelease. But with Sims 2, unlike Sims 1, I\'ve always found it was pretty trivial to get running well on modern PCs.) \n\nSims 2 is widely considered the best, though I haven\'t played 3 yet so I can\'t speak to how they compare. But it\'s definitely missing some features, and has some issues. The Business DLC is basically broken, ime. Not ""broken"" as in ""super easy to cheese,"" broken as in pretty much useless and impossible, like the mechanics are fundamentally borked in ways mods can\'t completely fix. \n\nSo I think you could kind of argue at this point that for those dissatisfied with The Sims 4, The Sims 2 and 3 do function as available alternatives.', '> A game of this nature is unusually difficult and costly to develop. \n\nI mean I feel like this is the obvious answer.\n\nLook at how much high-quality 3d assets Sims 4 uses. Look at how much work the CPU is doing to wrangle all these complex interactions and variables.\n\nAnd it\'s not like other genres where you can downgrade presentation and make up for it by offering deeper mechanics. I think Sims players care a lot about how their game looks, from the Sims themselves to the world they live in. Making good-looking Sims and homes for them to live in is half the reason the games sell so well to begin with.\n\nIt\'s a genre where buzzwords like ""immersion"" actually matter (note that ""immersion"" is different from ""realism"" here). If, for example, you tried to do a pixel art Sims, you\'d wind up attracting more Stardew Valley players than Sims players.\n\nIf you want to compete with Sims, you have to at least be comparable in quality to Sims 4.

The devs ducking suck dude.\nThis is the most bugged pos you will ever waste your money on.\nThese devs point blank don\'t know wtf they\'re doing. It shows in how ducking inconsistent everything the do to this game is.\nArmor? Its arbitrary if it works or not. Same with hit boxes and hit registration in general. This game has BAD desynch and player synch issues its just terrible net-code.\nYou get invisible players, you get missing audio all over the place, or just weird audio that seems muffled when it shouldn\'t be. Or audio that is WAY OFF of the actual person your listening too.\nNd most of this is caused by dog poo net-code and dog poo servers because BSG is cheap pieces of shih. They desperately need to hire experienced coders because Nikita and the boys cant write good anything to save their lives. Nikita can barely function as a human\xa0 being sometimes, I see him trying to speak in his interviews. Dude has 100% brain power on to form a sentence.\xa0 TF is he gonna write some acceptable net-code? In what reality? I don\'t think Rick Sanchez himself could find a reality where BSG isn\'t dog poo at what they do. Its frequently one step forward and 4 steps back with BSG and any CHANGES they implement will be absolutely abysmally implemented at launch every single time.\nNot even NORMAL levels of Beta game stuff. Were talking its almost gotta be intentionally designed like poo. Look at the arena preset trees there is ZERO balance to be had here lol. Its not IMPOSSIBLE to balance these classes despite Tarkov being a Unbalanced game in general. But these devs don\'t have thew common sense or gamer sense for that matter to understand what balance even IS. Its like they gave each tree a dev and then shoved em in a closet like harry potter and made em build the whole tree without any communication or teamwork with the other guys to even ACHIEVE any kind of sense of balance to begin with. The transitions are too steep. And tree to tree its unbalanced as duck so being out classed is even worse than it should be right now cause their SO MUCH ahead of you it gets ridiculous.\nIts low-effort.\nThis game gets away with murder in todays world with how piss poor it is in all reality. Most inconsistent game with half way working everything, with desynch you haven\'t seen since dial up AOL days. Nd every ""fix"" they do doesnt really fix poo.\nLights still penetrate solid floors and you can see people using flashlights thru ceilings when you shouldn\'t (commonly seen on interchange)\nObject pop up is also horribly implemented. Nd there is a ton of places to this day where you can sit and se thru poo when you shouldn\'t be able to because it doesnt pop in until your 50 yards from it when everything else is popping in fine. Again this happens in interchange at emercom side lower level. I don\'t wanna give the spot away cause its stupid enough as it is.\nHit detection has always been horrible. The game will just flat out ignore SECONDS of action on your side. Its like the servers are nodding off on heroine and if you get in a gun fight while its taking a poo, which is ever 20-30 seconds or so, expect 70% of your hits to flat out not register even if you see blood or flinching from impacts, its all purely on your side of the server and the other guys side doesnt even realize your shooting at him. Its atrocious. And there are plenty of example of it being at its worst. Just look at the landmark arena video.\nLol listen to the announcers. Its almost like they\'ve never seen such bullshit in a TOURNAMENT before... My point being Tarkov is WILDLY bad. Especially in comparison to ANY other shooter that can hold a candle to it. This is 100% dev incompetence. Not knowing what tf their doing and NEEDING help but not being willing to take it. Because king Nikita thinks its better to develop a poo game that he can say I made that, than a good game that WORKS and was a team effort. Nikita is a man child.\nLets check out some more examples of Tarkov fuckery. You know what? where\'s my white board? This was a long time coming.\nHit reg example 1\nHit reg example 2\nHit boxes arent reliably in the right place example 1. Head shot either completely didnt register or it counted as a body shot. Clear bullet hole in face for the disbelievers.\nAnother failed hit box on a headshot. Slow down to .25, clear head-eyes and it even counted as a hit and did damage to body, it counted as a chest shot. Even tho it clearly wasn\'t. Example 2. poo hit boxes.\nZero hits at end screen.\n\nAs you can see these videos range from recent to years old. This is a prevalent issue and there is a SEA of example I can pull from. EVERYONE knows at this point Tarkovs hit reg, hit boxes and desync of servers is ducking TERRIBLE. No other game would get away with this level of incompetency for the price point they push for the game especially.\n\nNd this is stuff that happens assuming NO other bugs come along and duck UP YOUR GAME. That means audio, animation bugs that freeze you into a state of complete uselessness. Back end failures that poo you back into the menus where it takes the game 6 years to load ANYTHING. Having 4-5 minutes load times sometimes. Nd the general RNG nature of this game.\nASSUMING all that works for you, you STILL got these hit reg issues hit box issues and desync to worry about ruining every encounter you get into.\nOn Tarkov, things WORKING is as frequent in happening as bugs in other better made games. When EVERYTHING is working fine, thats a blue moon thing for this game. Thats what you pay for.\nThese devs need to pull their heads out of their asses and start actually FIXING these issues instead of pussyfooting around like their working on them, to literally never fix them. Any other game would be crucified for the poo this game gets away with. For DOUBLE the cost to alot of us than what a regular ass game cost. Idk bout you but i put 150 bucks on BSGs feet when I bought this game. So being 7 years old and these clowns still aint fixed poo witht hat support money.... I\'m just like, dude duck you guys. Fix your ducking game. No I wouldn\'t recommend Tarkov right now.\nIts ducking hilarious they were bragging and marketing Arena as Esports ready lol. I mean comical they believed that poo.\n\nYea there is something going on with the hit detection for sure, when I do single player practice mode the game is completely different.', '>>> 6 hours ago, XariusX said:\n1) the Developer has not made any strides in combating cheating. It is absolutely rampant and unchecked.\n\nThey are constantly adjusting their (3rd party) anti-cheat, but yes, the cheater problem is serious.\n\n>>> 6 hours ago, XariusX said:\n2) The Developer is horrendous at communication with the player base\n\nSo? I\'m here for their game, not their communication skills.\n\n>>> 6 hours ago, XariusX said:\n3) The games audio is completely broken with no clear roadmap on getting it fixed.\n\nIt\'s in a bad shape, but yet again, we\'ve had several iterations of the audio system already. They are not ignoring it.\n\n>>> 6 hours ago, XariusX said:\n4) After wipes the Dev team goes radio silent when it comes to issues about the game. It\'s been in Beta forever and they continue to hide behind that like it excuses their incompetence.\n\nWhat issues? You couldn\'t get into a raid within 10 minutes after wipe, only 30? Get real, we used to have days of server outages after wipes, when every player who owned EFT flooded the servers.\n\n>>> 6 hours ago, XariusX said:\n5) While they typically do 2 wipes a year, it\'s only actually ""fun"" for about 2 weeks until the cheat makers have finished testing their limits and then cheating turns rampant and becomes self defeating.\xa0 The cheaters make the legit players leave, then the passive closet cheaters get tired of getting rage cheated on and they quit leaving the servers in a sorry state of a few people who just can\'t let go and move on.\n\nKind of true, the game is more enjoyable when people have gear parity. Late-wipe sucks for people who cannot play hours each day.But hey, you can still 1tap a fully geared chad with a pistol if you go for the eyes.\n\n>>> 6 hours ago, XariusX said:\n6) The streamers for this game are completely beholden to the developer , you will not find streamers more afraid to stand up to a Developer on any other game. You can\'t trust them, and they are coping hard. A few have made the wise choice to move on to making other content.\n\nIdk which streamer you\'re alluding to, but most big (english speaking) streamers have had some kind of ruffle with BSG already. They are also critical about the game, not just you.\n\nTL;DR;The game is far from perfect, but still gives a unique experience that no other game can match as of today.But it\'s definitely not for everyone.']"

The tension is there in not missing the parry or dodge timing. Just because invalidating damage is possible doesn't mean it applies to all situations. \nYou could say that dark souls has zero tension because you can parry and dodge in that game too and that too would be a ridiculous statement. \n\nI agree with your second point act 2 suffered from turning all viable builds into multi hits cause of the damage cap. I felt so robbed when I unlocked the cap and saw how much it limited my damage. \n\nAct 3 does have a bit of a scaling issue but that's okay, by that point in the game you have so many pictos to deal with things. I did a few of the harder challenges earlier because I had the freedom to swap to tankier builds. Stacking HP and shields. \n\nJust because a glass cannon DPS build is strong it doesn't mean that it's the only way to play it. \n\nTLDR your first point is wild and hyperbolic"", '>The more time you spend with the boss the more chances you will miss and take damage that\'s why you want to get the fight done quickly but going too much towards damage means even one mistake early on can one shot you without proper defence.\n\nI think the problem here is that dodgy/parry is so powerful, it\'s mostly balanced out by all the enemies having increasingly bullshit attack patterns, arguably the worst in the history of parry-games, which then further incentivises going glass cannon and getting through it quickly, because the alternative is prolonging the fight twice as long on a ""tanky"" build that gives you only 25% more survivability and leaves you starved of AP. \n\nIt\'s fairly obvious how the game wants you to be playing. Missing a single dodge/parry gives you enormous negative feedback, AP recovers with parries, the game is littered with optional bosses 90% of whom are vastly overleveled and will just one-shot you unless you parry for 45 minutes, parry/damage-based skills, weapons, and pictos are plentiful, most of the defensive pictos aren\'t unlocked until fairly late in the game and require such a specific combination of pictos to truly be tanky it feels like somewhat of a cheese strat rather than an intended alternative playstyle. \n\nIt\'s not that the game fundamentally expects you to be this godlike player who nails every parry, it\'s just that dodge/parry is integral to the core gameplay experience to such extent that the final product feels much more like an action-Soulslike wearing the skin of a JRPG for the \'git gud\' crowd.', 'The only bad thing on this game is there are not enough bosses to parry.']"
