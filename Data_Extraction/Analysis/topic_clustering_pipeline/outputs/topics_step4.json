      "You don't think Riot Games would ban third party plugins from their game where they have maybe the most invasive and strict anti-cheat in all of gaming?",
      "Who is considered cheater for LP return? Scripter? I rarely see one, almost never since Vanguard dropped. Account share, Nami/Soraka/Janna/Lulu main solo carry as Kassadin/Ziggs/Katarina, while swapping flash from F to D? Every other game! If thats considered cheating, they will give me at least 400 LP back. If acc level 30 with 90% winrate is cheating, i will be promoted to grandmaster as soon as patch drops.",
      "The Mac implementation is running in user mode. Riot is not expecting cheats to run on the kernel, because unlike Windows macOS does not allow code to run on the kernel.\n\nBut tbf, anti-cheats don't do much at the kernel level, mostly focusing on integrity. The cheat detection logic already run in user mode, the kernel drive ensures the user mode code is not being tampered by cheat engines.",
      "Well id be skeptical, despite running in user mode it is doing some shady things. I put the module through IDA Pro and found a screenshot module, the server can remotely tell it to screenshot any process window or entire screen. It also constantly scans all files on your Mac even those in private folders (for example Chrome data). Just because its not running in the kernel doesnt mean it isnt overreaching or doing spyware like activity, because it is. For something that is meant to be a anti cheat it should be more focused on the integrity of the game executable/process itself, not Chrome data or taking screenshots of whatever it wants.",
      "Same here, sounds like a cheat code for teams willing to put in the effort- especially when it comes to the more difficult to reproduce sequences such as dragon fights",
      "“This means that active enforcement of Vanguard will be in effect and working hard to make sure your queues are free from scripters, botters, and cheaters! “ blatant lie hahaha all games with kernel level anti cheat stil have lots of cheaters.",
      "Because they're not running from boot, idiot. With other anti-cheats you can just enable your cheats before the anti-cheat starts, but you can't do that with Vanguard.\n\nIt's much, much harder to cheat with Vanguard compared to other anti-cheats, the vast majority of cheaters aren't gonna bother with it.",
      "Have you played valorant? Shits still rife with cheaters lol",
      "No but fck you for using cheats. People like you are the reason we have to deal with this."

I can watch the replay back (and even just reflect mid-gameplay) to figure out what that was. The bigger question is what more I could’ve done to win this game. Should I have gone for a different play? Been more patient? More aggressive? That’s what I’m trying to learn here. So feel free to critique my gameplay.",

I can't think of a way how you could ever get quantitative data from the game that would show this change was a net-negative for the metrics you referenced even if it truly were the case.",

This situation does not just involve huge money, but also the game's very future in China. You're so naive if you think they will not use this built-in mechanic to push their favored teams. Will they be so blatantly egregious about it that it completely handicaps less favored teams? No. But to not even tilt the champ pool to their favored winners??? LMAOOOO. This actually is very *very* tame as far as corporate corruption go, it tells a lot about your cushy life/denial that you think they won't resort to this.",

All of the smurfing /etc. changes they've been working on have caused them to under resource gameplay changes (which was the known tradeoff they made) according to Rioters.",

Setup my stuff 3 days later 340$ taken from my account because someone bought fifa cards or some bullshit for a game I don’t even own?! Then I had to spend time on the phone just to get my money and account back. Completely killed my drive to even want to play the game anymore.\n\n\nTLDR; If you are reading this Sony, fix your shit.

That was the first and only time something like that has happened to me, and it was the last time I used my PSN account.",

Still on them for not communicating the account requirement more for the next four months and now it being enabled again (is this mainly AH's doing or is Sony forcing their hand on it?).\n\n\nMost I can hope for is that AH uses this outrage a leverage to get the account requirement relaxed or removed. That would be best for their reputation. But this is AH who has to negotiate with a company like Sony so who knows🤷‍♂️. ",

I played a ton of Arena, Swarm, Nexus Blitz, etc\n\nI've been playing league for over a decade. I liked the weirder kit designs of older champions, the stronger and more interesting items/runes, and unorthodox but viable builds/gameplay. I liked the class reworks (even if they were chaotic, unbalanced messes). I feel like Riot is doing a significantly better job of actively balancing the game (because a lot of that stuff did lead to balance disasters) but I feel like the core direction of the game is going in a direction that I'm not hugely into. There's a thousand smaller things as well, which is why despite introducing stuff I do like I overall don't find myself playing too much recently",

The \"enjoyment\" comes from reading the enemy jungler better than they read me because I can recall and memorize things they can't.\n\nI think banning all the timers and add-ons and plug-ins would have been a better move than just implementing all of the excessive stuff that relieves the mental stack, but that's just me. I'm not a zoomer with termites eating my brain from age 4 on.\n\nAnd while I have you reading my reply, try and do something about the horrendous meta we've been in since Elder Drake was implemented. 5v5 team fight with no other way to win every single game for years now is very, very boring!\n\nAsks a question to jerk off to the audience and then doesn't even engage in the completely normal reply. Classic Rioter on r/lol moment.",
      "I might, though being able to easily check matchup build/rune differences (and matchup winrates in general), and opponent/teammate stats and info is still nice to have available. It'll definitely be *far* less useful during gameplay itself though not much of anything left moment to moment.",
      "No, not really. It's just artillery gameplay that literally nobody likes to play against",
      "> In pro play \n\nPro play is slow as fuck with as little fighting as humanly possible. It's why items like RoA are so common. Copying those builds in your soloQ games is usually really fucking bad.",
      "It's fundamentally a question of tradeoffs.  How much dev time are they willing to spend supporting a mode with 1% of the player base of their actually popular modes?  Why spend dev effort on something that the vast majority of players will never (or almost never) interact with, when they could put those resources into something that most players would actually appreciate?\n\nIn practice, when they did put effort into 3s, they didn't get sufficient player count to justify continuing that investment.  And when they didn't put effort in, the player count just dwindled further.  At that point, I can definitely understand riot's decision to just kill the mode entirely.  A few players really liked the mode, but it clearly didn't have broad appeal.",
      "Yeah I feel like it’s not worth it as a secondary at all these days unless you have a lot to gain from either cheap shot or sudden impact /:    Also with axiom in the game ult hunter is a no go from me",
      "i am a Dota enjoyer from time to time, but that game got outdated like 10 years ago. Shit tone of mechanics that aren't good anyway but they are here because \"thats how i played 20 years ago\" and character design is ass both design and kit wise.  \nSure there is a lot of active items that you can counter with but it just feels ass sometimes",
      "You saying you are a Dota enjoyer and your listing of things that are apparently wrong with the game do not match up whatsoever. You complain about character and kit design but everything has a counter in Dota and if everything is overpowered, nothing is. Also, there is no way you say that the game got outdated ten years ago when every few months Valve puts out a patch that massively changes everything about it. Oh yeah, like literally yesterday: https://www.dota2.com/wanderingwaters\n\nIf you want a game with shallow item, hero and mechanics design you already found it, you are in its very subreddit. League is fast paced and easy to understand from a micro and macro perspective. Dota is nothing like that.\n\nYou sound like you just want League of Legends but with a competent developer. Realistically that's not going to happen ever. I quit League about ten years ago and recently started again and if anything, everything that I hated about Riots balancing and design decisions has gotten worse."

I’ve uninstalled before and always come back but I can honestly say now the addiction has really been so much less than ever before. Is anyone else feeling the same way? If someone said I couldn’t play for 6 months I would honestly just say, oh right. If it was a few years ago I’d legit have no idea what I would play, not playing your favourite game. Maybe Overwatch just isn’t my favourite game anymore which is a great shame but I guess it gives me time to explore other games.",

But the forums are for some reason too addictive to me during work hours of all times. It’s just not good for me or the company I work for. So I’m quitting. Peace out. See you guys tomorrow.",
      "I just wanted to express my gratitude. I’ve been playing the game for a while now, but it hasn’t been truly enjoyable for me; it’s more of a time filler. The only mode I enjoy is rarely accessible to me—maybe 1 out of 10 games. I don’t understand why it’s so difficult to implement a preference system. I’ve never been as toxic in any other game as I have in this one, simply because it frustrates me when I finally get the mode I enjoy, only to find that the teams are unbalanced, leading to rushed gameplay on either side. Nevertheless, the latest event has completely drained the last bit of enjoyment I had left in the game. I hope to use this week to free myself from it… I’ve become somewhat addicted, but for that, I want to thank you for the opportunity.",

I feel like they really need to step up their marketing for features like that and (pre price hike) Gamepass. \n\nSony NEEDS the competition. They’re increasing prices, canceled their rewards program, and went all in on live service games this generation… most of which were canceled. Don’t get me wrong, I love my PS5 and I’m not one of those people who pretends we didn’t get awesome games this generation (playing through Ghost of Yotei right now), but when Sony gets complacent, they get arrogant, and we suffer.",
      "I'd love to know where this kind of energy was when Microsoft was trying to kill off PlayStation.\n\nSony has competition from other gaming platforms like PC, Nintendo and mobile. The entertainment industry in general is competition, as every subscription service that launches is potentially less revenue for Sony.\n\nOn a platform level, there is more competition than ever as now Gran Turismo competes directly against Forza on the same console. The next GT entry has to be something special or Forza will eat its lunch.",
      "Playstation has consistently released some of the best single player games every year this generation.\n\nReturnal, R&C,  Demon Souls, Spiderman 2, Spiderman MM, GOWR, Horizon FW, GT7, Astro Bot, Stellar Blade,  Ghost if Yotei, Death Stranding 2 and others. No idea why people act like they stopped making single player games just because they also invested in multiplayer games.\n\n\nPlaystation makes much of its profit from microtransactions from third party live service games. They decided they shouldn't rely solely on third parties for that profit. Especially when companies like Microsoft are buying massive chunks of the industry and the top earning games on Playstation like COD.\n\nSo youre both wrong. Playstation can't rely solely on just single player games because they make so much money off third party microtransactions. And Jim Ryan didnt cut the focus on single player games. They actually increased the budget for single player  games under Jim Ryan as well",
      "They’ve been saying that for 15 years. At some point, you have to move on. \n\nSony has been so successful with their first parties in part because they don’t beat a dead horse. They could have made Uncharted 5, 6 and Infinite but they moved on leaving it on a high note and made TLOU. They left that and now they’re on the new game.\n\nBy comparison Xbox cannot fathom a possibility without Halo. They’re obsessed with it to the point that they’ve driven it to the ground over and over instead of trying new things. They kicked their star developers out the door over it. Destiny could have been an Xbox first party game.",
      "Sony can see the data , above 60 % of transactions made from the ps store is live service games  cod. sp games account for less than 40 % . It makes sense as to why they are chasing it even if they burn a few billions along the way . Compared to other major game companies their live service offerings are weak . \n\nRealistically the only one game which could make a big splash is destiny 3 but I don't think sony would let bungie make it",
      "Time is a factor. If Sony was pushing PS3 hard during the PS4 era, fewer people would care. If they pushed PS3 backwards compatibility (as a hypothetical, I know it's not possible) TODAY, I think people would be pretty hyped to play MGS4, GTA 4, Resistance, etc. And I think that holds true for Xbox. At this point, ANY differentiating factor could only help them.\n\nAs for competition, again, I'm talking about direct competition in the console market. By and large, Sony doesn't go after mobile gamers and streaming services (they BARELY acknowledge Sony Pictures Core). I hope gaming doesn't become prohibitively expensive in the near future, but after the PS3 launch I'm hesitant to trust Sony to know what \"affordable\" means.",
      "What people on the internet say isnusually far from reality.\n\nReality is few people actually care about playing really old games on new consoles\n\nAnd Playstation is doing better than ever focusing on newer games\n\nSony knows PS3 wasnt affordable which is why they focused heavily on making PS4 and PS5 affordable. They did horribly on PS3 so they obviously know they can't do that again. They are more successful now than ever doing what they're doing, no reason to think they'll change that strategy",
      "Your PS3 will indeed play blurays, not the 4k ones though. They have a media remote for it too thats a bit less cumbersome to use.\n\nTheres quite a few ps4 and ps3 exclusives stuck on the console, like metal gear solid 4, bloodborne, etc. But i think for ps5 the big ones that wont come to pc are GranTurismo and Astrobot?\n\nGranturismo devs have said they want to and its something they consider, but the engine is so optimized for the hardware, it sounds like its not feasible. Not sure how true that is or if it would diminish the brand in their eyes.\n\nAstrobot probably because of controller specifics."

      "Same cart here. Played since S3, used to play it for few hours daily. Eventually that counter decreased to playing few games every few days, but keeping the game on a disk didn't hurt that much.\n\nNow with some kernel driver running all the time (even if only to kickstart another driver) on a PC I'm doing banking stuff, online shopping etc. I don't feel like leaving a game there won't mess up with me at some point. Not particularly now, but one cannot rule out it won't happen ever (hacker breaching into Riot, or rogue employee carefully placing some not-obviously-shady code - kind of recent xzutils case, where it took about 3 years to plant a critical backdoor). So if I was already declining in playtime, then the choice whether or not install some driver I'm promised it won't do anything bad (well, would anyone promise otherwise?) or just catalyze the declining process and leaving the game on good memory seemed easy.",
      "One thing I'll say about vanguard is that ever since they added it, I now have to restart my computer every other game because I get unfixable critical error loops that don't go away even after force closing the game in task manager. And I can't repair because the game detects nothing wrong with itself or my computer",
      "I don't have an old setup, but without DX9 I get weird random frame crashes, and screen freezes. DX9 fixes it. Another victim of the unoptimised mess the game still is.",
      "Its also had problems of not playing nice with other software and drivers, peoples fans being disabled in the bios, software failing to function, drivers being broken, BSOD issues, slow PCs (Like booting up or even just playing other games), peripherals like KB+M being rendered unusable, many reports of bricked PCs but I'm not too sure about that being true. It also runs 24/7 on your computer which is absurd, its active and has access to everything on your computer when your not even playing a game, ridiculous.\n\nPrivacy is a big issue here especially when it comes to installing a rootkit on your PC (Call it anti-cheat all you want, this is a rootkit), but Riot can't even make a functioning client that doesn't break every two seconds and we're supposed to trust them to not break our PCs with kernel level anti-cheats?\n\nThere's also the issue of can people even run the damn thing? Big draw with LoL is that you can play it on a potato PC, that's what a large amount of the player base still uses I presume, I wonder how badly the player-base will drop from this, probably tiny but still curious.",

      "Just a heads up; the most recent AMD driver (Adrenalin 24.4.1) has issues on some configurations, causing driver timeouts and crashing the game. Fun fact, I had a crash mid game and I didn’t get banned because I had the sense to not just jump into a major game mode right after an issue. I did a Vs AI game  (where it crashed again) and decided to double check the release notes as I admittedly only checked the fixes this time. I could have rolled back the drivers, but I already finished the pass and don’t particularly care about titles…So I started going through my backlog. Currently playing Bayonetta 3.  Afterwards it DMC V and then Stellar Blade.",
      "then you should take a trip down to diablo 4’s tech support forum. game has been literaly filled with crashes, disconnects, bluescreening peoples pc since the launch of the expansion, and its STILL not fixed. count your blessings and be grateful ow2 is not coded by that group of devs.",
      "So with the myriad of problems this patch has (subjectively) there is one major problem: It just completely bent over Xbox players. The game loads in, but freezes and crashes immediately on the main menu. Really? C’mon. Guess I’ll start that Christmastime replay of Spiderman Miles Morales.",
      "My girlfriend recently kept getting the “Rendering devices lost, shutting down” error in her games and so naturally, she is leaving a lot of the games. Whenever we try a method to fix the issue, we have to test in quick play, and if she crashes again, then the leaving penalties add up. I still haven’t been able to fix the error, we tried many methods including the disk restore health, sfc scan, cleaning drivers, reinstalling drivers, using nvidia profile cleaner, reinstalling the game, scanning the game, etc. So to avoid being banned again, I said, we can play in Arcade to see if the errors appear. I chose 6v6 cuz it is a mode that has more players to test the problem. What i didn’t know is that the 6v6 in THE ARCADE PLAYLIST, YES THE ARCADE PLAYLIST, WOW THE ARCADE PLAYLIST, THE PLAYLIST THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE FUN AND CHILL WOW, AND THE PLAYLIST THAT SUPPOSED TO LET YOU TEST STUFF, still has leaving penalties active so she got banned for 2 hours when she eventually crash again. I still remember people fervently defending this fundamentally intelligently challenged gamedev decision, and said go play Arcade if you want to leave. Like yea, now we have leaving penalties in Arcade now. I seriously do not comprehend the logic of leaving penalties. It is a bandaid solution to all the hidden problems of this game. It serves nothing but alienates the playerbase, further splitting the already divided and toxic playerbase. Rainbow Six Siege, a very competitive game, even more competitive than OW2 itself, also has a Quick Play mode and they don’t have leaving penalties."

      "PSN’s still at 22,931 (as of this second, I just logged in to check.) During weekdays it’ll probably drop due to people being back in school. We’ll probably see more players during weekends and late afternoons now. \n\nI’ll admit, it’s depressing to see the player count drop over time. But it makes sense. With all the drama, problems with Sony and AH, negativity from most of the online community, and new games coming out, I’d expect that the player count would drop significantly. It happens with every live service game.",
      "So we all know that Sony decided to gather as many people as they could and force people to register PSN accounts to continue playing the game and force developers to accept this by changing the agreement before 24 hours. \n\nI decided to let developers know what think about this situation via email (don't have the answer for now) and a review on the Steam store page. Also, I wrote a complaint to Steam support and got my refund in only one day.\n\nI think that this situation is just fraud and an attempt to get people's data. Sony is known for their leaks of personal data.",
      "I always had issue with Sony where if I tried to register a Sony account for my Playstation Vita in the Philippines, it wouldn't work. I'd always just register it as a USA account since I'm technically from there. but it always meant that I couldn't buy items in the online stores.\n\nFor some reason Sony really just ignores these regions, and pretends they don't exist. I suppose in the past, it's because there was a high prevalence of piracy, but I had thought that the modern thinking about this is that piracy can mostly be solved by offering a better service that what piraters offer (steam offers games at discounted rates, and provides a platform that is way easier to use than torrents, at a risk of getting a virus as well)\n\nThere will always be people who think they should have everything for free. But even people who don't have much money are willing to buy something to support the developers who made a game, if they're just given a chance.",
      "I have had this problem since the beginning, Play station does not have my country in the account creation page. I got around this by creating my account with a relative's US address.\n\nThey also don't accept non US credit cards. I got around this by purchasing gift cards for PSN and store purchases.\n\nMy playstation is rarely used and I don't pay for PSN anymore, The network issues make playing online unbearable.\n\nSony has made using their product stupidly difficult and unfun for users in my position.",
      "Their CEO admitted to knowing it was a requirement for months and still turned it off. They made a single statement about it on the Discord and that was it when they did. Then after Sony announced they were going to force it stayed quiet like a little bitch for 4 days while he and his CSMs riled up the fan base against Sony.\n\nSony is still shit and shouldn't have been selling the game in non PSN countries but it begs the question why no one stopped it because AH and Sony should be able to see where people are logged in from. All together this is just like with Magicka all over again AH being fucking incompetent and Sony just being fucking out of touch.",
      "Sony made a business decision to remove the requirement in exchange for selling more copies. \n\nWithout removing the PSN account requirement the servers would have been constantly full, fewer people would have bought, more would have refunded because they couldn't play, and the momentum of sales would have been broken.\n\nNow they want to have their cake and eat it too, but they should have seen it was too late, especially with all the sales in non-supported countries for PSN accounts.",
      "It works fine in countries that don’t have psn account access you just need to select the closest country available. It’s actually a non issue. People in such countries have been playing PlayStation like this for a decade. \n\nThe bugginess of this new computer sign up system is a legit problem but that’s not a permanent legal issue as demonstrated by the fact that mobile browsers were able to use the website when desktop users couldn’t. This is the first game Sony is using this computer sign in system and they are clearly experiencing some issues.",
      "Sony did let the game get sold in regions that they don't explicitly support, and they shouldn't have, but if the PSN requirement was never removed, those players would have never gotten 2 hours of play time and they could easily immediately return the game.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution, but one that would have avoided all of this drama, and likely been resolved properly when all of the returns and complaints were made that they were allowed to buy a game they couldn't play.",
      "First, sony lost the PSN account battle. Now, they've finally given up on the region lock blockade!",
      "Great game, but Sony can suck eggs. at least they've backed off on the psn requirement. \r\n"

Like lvl 25 max and lvl in passives or a big map change that completely shakes everything up or a new rune page or something.",
      "Am I crazy how is this a small patch? Feels like a bunch of fairly significant champion changes on top of the dshield/second wind nerf what is the expectation here?",
      "I started season 4. We had a short time where they tried to keep the roatating game mode alive but that fizzled out quickly (or just alternated between ascenision and some other mode). They actively want to release fewer champs because people kept complaining and it became harder to create balanced champs. We barely had any significant sr changes from s8 to s14. This year got atakhan, changes to the terrain and bushes as well as the split changes to the map.",
      "> barely any significant sr changes from s8 to s14\n\nRunes Reforged, Tower Plates, Elemental Rifts, Dragon Soul, Elder rework, Mythic Items, Hextech and Chemtech Drakes, Removal of Mythic Items, Grubs, Herald rework, Baron rework, the plethora of Jungle reworks and Support reworks etc. were not significant...? That's just ignorant buddy.",
      "No because half of the things you said were added and then removed/remworked because they didnt work these weren't some grand system changes. Dragon and Baron changes are fine to mention once we also got voidgrub changes this year so idk why you feel like this slowed down, the most impactfull jungle reworks were before s8 where they added gromp and the scuttle crab unless I missremember.  The only thing which is reduced this year compared to the years before is some half assed item rework which you can critizise but pretending that riot are adding less content to league now is just wrong especially when you consider the qol. and behavoir changes.",
      "Are you seriously not going to think it through?  You already are like 80% of the way there.\n\nThe bit you are missing is that the changes are temporary.  It is patching for the largest event of the year, like they have done every year (to different levels of chaos/balance/success), before returning to normal balancing afterwards.",
      "Yes, there was a time they let the game evolve and balanced towards those natural changes as a new meta took hold. And then cycle in item/rune/map/champ updates, and you're always going to have something new coming out.\n\nI think it's gross to openly steer balance in a direction they want just to force certain \"Approved\" champion pools to the World stage. Why try to innovate on game strategies, when final say just comes down to whatever Riot wants to see on stage.",

In this patch we're experimenting with removing the ability to ban your ally's hovered champion to help alleviate these negative interactions. We'll be watching how this change goes and listening to your feedback before making a call on whether we revert this change or roll it out worldwide, so please let us know what you think! \n\nHow would we give feedback to let Riot know what we think of this change? Post about it on social media?",
      "One question, can you ban your own hovered champion? Sometimes I get a little excited before ban phase and forget there's a buffer.",
      "If someone hovers yasuo i hover something i want banned, then i ban yasuo and 99% of the time my hover gets banned too which is win win",
      "I’m a big fan of this change! It’s not without its downsides but tbh the amount of times I see a self team ban for practical reasons is far outweighed by the times I see it used to screw over a teammate. Also imo if one of your teammates wants to risk the opp sniping a busted pick for the chance to play it I think its fine for them to have priority on that over your desire to not play against that busted champ. Like as a general rule you don’t get much sway on what your teammates want to play, leaning into that is for the best imo rather than having this one exception that leads to a significant chunk of feel-bad games. I wouldn’t mind an exception for new champs though since releases can be particularly messy and new champs have an absurd pick rate during that period(though I would also be fine if the no banning of hovers applies to them)\n\nEDIT:also as far as the banning of “troll picks” goes, I think it’s a pretty silly argument. If your teammate is actually making a pick to troll then your ban does nothing, you can’t ban every silly option in the game. If it’s just suboptimal, well I guarantee that the vast majority of players are not using the optimal pick for each patch. If they’re in your elo based off that pick then it is what it is(and if they’re in norms, its norms your teammates can goof around if they wanna and banning one “troll pick” doesn’t stop them from using another weird choice instead).",
      "As I Said previously theres 2 enormous issues with this (and its a main teemo jungle that says it so I know what it does feel to get my champ banned in lobby )\n\n* after some bad balance patch and a champ is omega Z tier pick or ban « freewin » in high elo , if the team side dont have the fp, not banning it because a mate over it is terrible / may bring worse global ambiant .\n\n*newly released champs in ranked the first patch are often a pain to go through when its in your team ( hello first timers + lets see if it can randomly be played on x role) I think having the right to ban it for at least one whole patch after release would be a good idea.\n\nIf those 2 specific points can be taken care off i think its a wonderful idea (+ maybe allow people ban nunu if a Guy not jungle hovers it ; because its not often a genuine player but a big griefer and nunu is the King of it ; he can even out smite his jungler while following him like a pet ( yes we all had this one game as main junglers i think ))",
      "The thing is if someone is picking a stupid pick, banning it isn't going to help. The person who wants to play Garen support won't go \"ah, my teammate banned my hover, I guess I have to go Thresh now.\" They're going to at best run it down, and more likely pick an even worse option to punish the teammate who banned their champion.\n\nBeing allowed to ban your teammates bad pick doesn't help because the winrate you'd gain from them *not* playing it is less than the winrate you'd lose from them purposefully playing worse, likely on an equally bad or worse pick.",
      "Bad change. When there is a problem of people banning the hovered champion, remove the function to hover. If I don't want a champion in the match I have the right to ban it, that is what bans are for.",
      "The only thing I'd like is to allow me to ban the new champ when it comes out",
      "Not a good change tbh, people should be able to play more than one champion, based on team/enemy etc. Forcing us to play against something or with something that we have difficulty with is a vad idea. Thanks god there is a solution. If someone hoovers champion i really hate and ban most of the time, I can hoover his biggest hard counter so he can not ban him... there is no other way to avoid it. Back in the days you did not even have roles given and everything was based on who picks first, that person gets role he/she wants and others had to adapt. Now you force everyone to let snowflake gen to play what they want in ranked or they would cry, why is there the ban option? You can just remove it with this change. If someone wants to play given champ, then there is a gamemode call quick match where he can play whatever champ.",
      "If hovering champions is a problem, remove the ability to hover champions. Bans should be absolute."

Cooldowns and mana costs are about creating interesting gameplay for the opponents, as opportunities to press an advantage. League has been about who can press all their buttons the fastest for a while now and the removal of CDs and mana is absolutely a big contributor to that issue.\n\nI was including the no resource wanks like the windshitters in there too, Yasuo bullying mages from S3 was undoubtedly relevant to dumbing down mage gameplay.\n\nYeah they did build mana back then, and they still had mana costs, because mana is and always has been important to mages, of course... i'm not saying they literally have no mana anymore...",

It feels too big, there are way too many walls like you’re running into a maze and it takes forever to find health bars unlike OW1 maps which is more open and direct. The iconic and chaotic Temple of Anubis, Volksaya Industries and Hanamura are infinitely better than the abysmal i’m seeing today.",
      "I’ve been thinking, as an aspiring 3D artist, about how I could make on OW spiritual successor. I wonder if there is appetite in the market for this. How many of you are only here because there is nothing quite else that scratches the OW itch? Not saying I would make one, but I wonder what all people are desiring from OW that it could be doing better. For one, a less algorithmic matchmaker would do wonders. Throw in some suggestions so other aspiring coders and artists can learn from OW’s mistakes."

      "Also worth mentioning that you're not really talking about \"champion mains\" in isolation here with your statistics, you're talking about a small sample size of the highest winrate players on that champion in the world. \n\nSo Qiyana can (and does) have a small handful of players smurfing on lower quality servers with an 80% winrate and significantly inflate that +11% WR delta for \"champion mains\". Whereas that might not be the case for Jinx. \n\nAs is the case for all data with low sample size it's more significantly affected by outliers.

      "wouldn't let me respond to your response directly:\n\nyou're not creating a logical argument; you haven't articulated what WR has to do with anything. nor have you actually responded to what I said. \n\nyou're trying to shoehorn in a point, but if you read what I say, and then your response, it becomes immediately apparent you're completely failing to address any of what I actually said\n\ni am refuting the idea that Bard is way better than Jinx simply because OP said so. you are going on about win rates while failing to explain the relevance",
      "These are only stats for ranked games; even enchanters are still played there, although they've been almost nonexistent in normal games for about five years now (Nami and Soraka used to be in every two or three games).\n\nWe don't have any general stats, other than subjective observations. I play in the most common MMR, and Seraphine has almost disappeared. She used to be played by those who liked her; it was always about high points and skins. Now, it's mostly newbies trying out a free champion with a skill level below 20k. That's the difference. I've seen stats showing that around 40% of players have even tried ranked.\n\nRanked stats aren't really applicable to a simple casual champion like Seraphine.",
      "lowkey stopped playing league because of this\n\nironic because they finally started adding stuff i DO like (maps and game modes)"

      "the game is dead for a reason, i can barely call it a hero shooter. id more so refer to non payload maps as tower defense where you camp the best spot on the map all game because you cant cross into enemy territory so easily. for payload maps id call it a game of who has the better spy cause you cant make plays or you die instantly so youre more susceptible to him. also torb is not comparable to engineer in any way."

      "And when i wrote ticket they replied some robot message, such a sad company. PS5 EU T500 support S9 now ends 460 instead of t500, all 40 lost their title which they already had, small indie company",

      "Larian Studios, we want to play with our friends from different platforms.\nYou promised many months ago that you would make this possible and you haven't given us any news.\nYou're working on everything, unnecessary kiss animations and mods that are just an extra detail.\nIt is even a great disrespect for consumers that you are working on everything other than what you promised.\nI bought the game thinking it wouldn't take long for crossplay to come out, but you don't even mention it.\nI have several friends who haven't bought the game yet because there's still no way for PS5 to play with PC and Xbox, and they're just a small part of a large audience that hasn't bought it yet because there's still no way to play with friends from different backgrounds. platforms.\nThere are many players who are not interested in playing alone.\nYou are losing money by not prioritizing this.\nPlease wake up Larian Studios.",
      "Good for you for speaking up, I really hate what all these stores have become and it's only going to get worse as AI tools become more mature.\n\nI wish you luck, perhaps through calling attention in places like this you can get PlayStation to wake up and do something. I've heard that once a publisher gets approved they don't really look too deeply into what they release, so perhaps the holdup for you? Who knows, but it's certainly a mess.\n\nAlso, I don't think this post will get taken down as another dev spoke up as well recently in /gaming (I also recommend creating a post there or quoting this one there). It's a shame it's come to this.",
      "I agree 100% with you, im just answering you about Shovelware revenues. Yes they make alot of profit because Trophy Hunters, They beat the game in 30s to 10 minute games and earn 12 Gold Trophies and 1 Platinum. Trophy Hunters are rising, they are already Millions trophy hunter gamers. They are highly competitive to the leaderboards. They hunt Triple AAA games, they Hunt Rare trophies or very hard games and next they buy 100 shovelware games each one for a value of 0.12c to 0.50c in promotion sales, to get an extra of 100 fast platinuns. to rise their account. Also Sony this year already rised and upgraded the Limit of LEVEL cards from PSN users to incentive to get more trophies more platinuns. Trophy Hunters works like this, Beating hard games with rare trophies and next they get 100 fast platinuns to rise in leaderboards, and then they go back for another triple AAA game! Shovelwares only still exist because Trophy Hunters Buys them. \n\nAnd you are right about buying by Mistake... yes you are right too, but buying by mistake its only 10%.\n\n90% are trophy hunters!\n\nGood luck Brother, i just wanted to show you this side of trophy hunting information!\n\nin 2000 shovelware games selling them from 0.50c to 1 dollar, in a years they sold like 100k-200k copies in all games, SONY does a big profit doing nothing XD",
      "Hey, thank you it's all good. I just wanted to vent a bit haha, I mainly play on PlayStation most of the time so seeing all this really bums me out. Back in the good old days I used to navigate the wishlist section to find upcoming games myself but since now it's all filled up with AI flood it's useless. Releasing a game then used to give us some visibility in that section, but now it just ends up buried in that mess too.  \n  \nI do agree that this is a problem across every storefront though and not just PlayStation and from what I understand it’s often the same companies operating across multiple stores so it’s probably the same people.",
      "We don't really know why. Best speculation is that there are rights issues behind the scenes. The studio who made it, Ready at Dawn, and Sony split ways, they were acquired by Reality Labs/Meta and ultimately shut down. So its possible they'd have to ask for use of the game in ps plus even though they were directly involved in its creation. Rights for this stuff are complex and annoying\n\nOr it could be something as simple as they think the game is bad and not worth including on ps plus because they think it makes them look bad. But, imo those things make the game a perfect ps plus title\n\nIt has been 10 years since the game came out, I think its pretty unlikely to ever be added. If they wanted to do it they would have done it by now. And with the [announcement that they're focusing on only ps5 games on psplus starting in January](https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-payday-3-high-on-life-pac-man-world-re-pac/) its all but guaranteed to not be added, since it is a ps4 only game. Unless it's added within the next few months, it's safe to say it never will be. \n\nI wish it would be added though, I honestly don't want to spend money on the game. But if it's not added by January I'll drop the $10 or whatever for it",
      "Xbox fucking sucks. But here’s why:\n\nEverything is about comparisons. If Xbox was the only console, it’d be great. But it’s not. You have the Switch right now and the Ps5… the switch has the cool little gimmick of pumping out nostalgic and fun Nintendo games that you that play virtually anywhere. And Ps5 has game companies under its wing that you simply can’t compete with… Naughty Dog, Santa Monica.. studios over there are going crazy. And don’t even get me started on the tech of the controller and system of the ps5… it’s smoother, simpler, plays better. \n\nBut Xbox does have gamepass. And gamepass is very cool. Know I can just play Senua as soon as that game comes out.. I’m here for it. But they are not pushing out anything that is jaw dropping, or console-defining. Anything you play on Xbox, Ps5 will run better, and I have yet to see an Xbox exclusive that was so good it was worth buying one of these things for. \n\nI own an Xbox. Girlfriend owns a Ps5… everything about the ps5 is better, save for maybe their little PlayStation catalog.",
      "Obviously this is just my opinion. Personally, I would not count any of the cross-platform games as being next-gen. They were PS4 games, designed for PS4, with spec-bumps for PS5. That means in the past 5 years, the only true PS5 exclusive 1st party titles we've gotten are Demon Souls, Rachet and Clank, Astro Bot, Yotei, and Spiderman 2? So 1 exclusive a year?\n\nThe live service push was such a disaster that they fired Jim Ryan over it and since games are taking 5-7 years to make now, the teams that haven't been laid off yet won't have something new to show until well into the PS6 generation. I think the fact that Playstation has been relatively quiet these past two years in terms of 1st Party is indicative of a temporarily stagnant line-up, when compared to PS4 and the latter-end of PS3."

      "> Catch Up Missions\n\n> We’re also introducing some changes to how the weekly missions will work so that Battle Passes feel better in terms of progression and how often you’re able to complete them. Starting in patch 25.13, instead of weekly missions lasting for 7 days, weekly missions will stick around for 21 days. This means that every week you’ll get a set of new weekly missions and you’ll have multiple weeks to complete them.\n\nI wish they'd just make them the same way a lot of other games do (going off just Fortnite and Apex here, anyone else add games where you know their BP system). \n\nEach week there are missions. Weeklies last _all season_. So if you start playing in the last week and want to grind every single mission in 7 days, you can. You'll still be missing a chunk of XP from daily mission(s) and play-time XP but at least you won't be severely behind from all the weeklies being gone.\n\nEven this improved 21-day system is FOMO-bait, which is Riot's MO for paid content I suppose.",

      "I mean having to unlock characters on a heavily meta based game and not pay to win in the same sentence is pretty iffy to say the least\n\n\nLeague and to its extent valorant are freemium at most",

      "I have been a league addict for 15+ years. I literally started playing in the closed beta when it was friends and family only.\n\nI have not touched the game since Thanksgiving and it feels great. This is literally the longest I've gone without playing in 15+ years.\n\nI cannot condone the gatcha system. I barely tolerated the $500 Ahri skin. The $250 Jinx skin was the door to leave being open. The Sett gatcha skin cemented it. I'm done with League so long as all this gatcha shit remains. It's morally reprehensible.\n\nAnd while I'm no massive whale, I've spent about $2000 over the years. I've tried my best to support the game. But I guess Riot don't want some money, they want all of it. And will milk the whales till their teets are black and broken.\n\nLeague has always been a game you hesitated to suggest to people, but now it's a full \"stay the hell away.\""

I personally like playing Dive with my friends, it’s a fun and rewarding experience, but it kind of sucks to play Winton on your own, so my gorilla muscles are pretty rusty.",

      "I swear, for like the last year or so people are pushing this narrative that dive is the go to game style that everybody should play and that is how the game should be or that is the most enjoyable teamcomp. Well newsflash, some people don’t enjoy that, not everybody likes their gameplays to be a rush mess were you just spam cooldowns in order to get a pick, and don’t know what is happening most of the time And if you are playing against a dive as a healers you are in a eternal game of tag where you might pray to God that their attention spam is 3 seconds so you can sneak out and change to brig or moira",
      "Dive is the worst comp to play against. I would kill for a dive to get deleted from the game. As supports its the worst. A diva with 725hp flys into you and you cant do anything, it is so stupid. I wish i could leave games against dive. I can hear the comments play Brig or xyz it dosent matter if she or winton flys into you. You are going back to spawn.",
      "Wasn’t that hero made for people who were incapable of dealing with dive so why is it being played when there are 0 divers in the game",
      "I never really got the whole “dive is the best meta ever” thing until now tbh. Gone are the days of holding a corner and hoping my guys will take an off angle, It feels like i have so much more agency! I wonder if Tesla would be romantically interested in Winton. Just… gotta avoid the points with only a single choke…",
      "seems like there just too many dives.  everyone is dive now. reaper is dive, genji, venture, sombra, tracer, winston, doomfist, phara, hell even orisa has been diving, … i mean, please just stop already.  I get it…your GM base probably has ZERO problem dealing with this, but you do realize you have OTHER people besides GMs that play…right?  you do realize that…right?.. You give all these great tools for dps to escape, become invulnerable, invisible, but for supports, you give LIGHT versions, that last for just a split second… just stop making dives…we have too many already",
      "Literally all you have to do.  If a dive tank dives, it should BE A CHOICE to ignore them. Currently its not. They do too much damage to ignore. LET IT BE A STRATEGIC CHOICE."

      "One of my favorite things in this game is when I think someone has a troll pick & then crushes it. Aatrox jungle was the most recent one I remember, was going 1v4 at end of game \n\nI don't judge anyone's pick before the game even starts :)  (TBF it's low ELO so just about any pick can be good if the person piloting it is)",
      "Please for the love of god no. Juggernaut patch gives me actual nightmares",
      "Same. EUW. I just played a game on Veigar's Curse instead of Veigar's Doom xdd",
      "I'm so happy I got my doombot wins before the nerfs, now I hope I can beat Silk Song before cry babies ruin that too",
      "NGL doombots feels way easier now, it's not like older doombot was impossible if you have a nice comp. I got 35/0/smth playing illaoi against Leesin in Veigar's eivil (mostly because we have a support that save me from dying in king of the hill and snowball DKC really hard), so it's not like impossible to win against him.",
      "I feel like the effort I made to master doombots is gone now. Currently I know how to win every matchup and event even 5v5 KotH. They shouldve just made easy mode easier and let veigars evil be the same or even harder",
      "Wouldn't it also tell you if your death was worth it? In terms of gold earned?  Assuming the enemy didn't get a noteworthy objective afterwards?",
      "Item is becoming a somewhat ridiculous stat stick, but it still doesn't have much of a user base. Most champs would still prefer going Shadowflame over this and that's what Horizon is in contention for. Base CDs are so low on so many champs that a lot of champs that might want it don't really get that much out of the 25 haste, and there are some rune options to gain on CDs without compromising build. And those that do want it already have an optimal build path in 99% of games where Horizon is tough to fit in.\n\nEvery mage is essentially Lost Chapter item / ROA, T2 Boots, Shadowflame/Zhonyas, Void/Crypt, then you can maybe go Horizon. But you'd probably just go Zhonyas or DCap instead since those are just strictly better items in the 4 slot when most of your fights are going to be 4v4 / 5v5 team fights.\n\nThere just aren't many champs in the game that want to go Lost Chapter / ROA into Horizon Focus. You have a lot of AP and CDR, but with no penetration or survivability, you're either not doing as much damage as you think or fights are very difficult to play out.",
      "Definitely not\n\nIt's one of those legacy playstyles of just infinite wave clear and god tier late game poking where if you don't draft hard engage you're kinda doomed. Artillery mages, although fun to play, are usually a really hard gameplay to balance tbh"

      "I truly hope Riot reconsiders the battle pass system going into next year. The old event shops felt like there was something for everyone each event, and you could squeeze some extra value out of it by spending your time on the game. The new battle passes are simply not worth purchasing unless you are specifically interested in the skins that it offers, and the meager essence rewards at the end of the pass are nearly worthless.\n\nAs someone who genuinely bought every event pass previously, I have spent $0 on RP this year, and I hope there are others who have voted with their wallets enough to show that this new system was a mistake.",
      "And new systems feels like im never getting my moneys worth unless the battlepass skins are 1. On champs I main and 2. Better or at least as good as the skins I probably already own on my mains (which there is probably no way) so I just never touch the battlepass lol",
      "Idk why we're pretending everyone bought the previous pass either, the old pass system everyone hated too lmao.\n\nYou spent like 2000 tokens on just the prestige then got very few if nothing else. You only bought that pass if you actually had enough tokens to get something you'd want... and it was usually just a chroma/icon+border skins often released with in a bundle anyways.\n\nBattle pass the FOMO is the part that sucks and if they removed that no one would bitch (this skarner skin will be the first since cosmic and it's MISSABLE... that's just plain stupidity), but if you finished it and tbf it doesn't take long to finish at all, you got everything in it.",
      "i dont get, where is battlepass then?(",
      "I just started playing the game and can for the life of me not find the battle pass tab.. Where do I click to open to see my progress etc?",
      "> We're also introducing some changes to how the weekly missions will work so that Battle Passes feel better in terms of progression and how often you're able to complete them. Starting in patch 25.13, instead of weekly missions lasting for 7 days, weekly missions will stick around for 21 days. This means that every week you'll get a set of new weekly missions and you'll have multiple weeks to complete them.\n\n> Currently, there's no catchup method for BXP that exists for players jumping in partway through the Act, or for someone who just missed some weeklies because they were busy. With this update you'll be able to accumulate missions for a while in case you aren't able to play for a week or two, so you'll still be able to make meaningful progress on your battle pass. You won't need to log in or do anything special for this to work, they'll be in your missions list when you log in. Here's what this will look like in practice: \n\nMy feedback would be: Make the weekly missions act-long. Fortnite for example has the weekly missions all save up so even if you start playing in the last week of the season you can grind out all the weekly battle pass missions.\n\nThis 4 week thing is a very welcomed improvement but there's basically no good reason they can't be 'saved' every week up until the end.\n\nThe \"Act\" missions are still good and differentiated because they have multiple stages and typically require the long time commitment to finish them but the weeklies are typically quite easy to grind out and it's a shame to lose so much battle pass XP.",
      "> and it's a shame to lose so much battle pass XP\n\nIt's an engagement system, the point of which is to incentivize you to play regularly.  \nMaking you feel like you're missing out if you don't log in is exactly the point.",

      "It would be pretty much only for new accounts. If an account is playing on a VPN on one device ID up until it's level 30-50 and then suddenly switches to a new IP/ID the account should be reviewed. They can also look to see if the account is switching F/D for summoners, position played, suddenly spending all the saved-up BE that the leveler left. Also, names like \"whdfbqoube\" tend to be a giveaway.",
      "So when u are on the profile on the top left. It shows my battle.net account and my psn id account. Is that new?",
      "Hello everyone, I’ve been encountering the LC-208.001/server connection login error on PS5 and laptop using my main account. My alternate PSN + Battle.net account works fine on the exact same setup, so it’s clearly account-specific. I’ve also tried connecting using a completely different network (my phone as a hotspot) and the issue persists, further confirming that this is not a network problem. From community discussions and what I’ve learned: This error is often caused by Blizzard’s automatic account review system, which regularly checks accounts for cheats and communications. One user shared that a Blizzard staff member confirmed this: “208.001 is account-specific and seems to come from account reviews. This doesn’t mean you’ve been reported — it’s just a general check. Occasionally, something goes wrong when ending the check, giving error 208.001, which is why only high-level staff can unblock it.” Important: This is not a ban or report. It’s apparently an internal check that occasionally triggers an access error. I wanted to include links to forums and reddit posts but I can’t add them here. However, I have seen many recent posts and replies on this forum of others experiencing this same issue within the last 48hrs, so there is definitely something going on. Steps I’ve tried: Restarted PS5, laptop, and router Unlinked and relinked PSN + Battle.net connection Tested on another device (laptop) Tested on alternate account- which works fine Tested on a completely different network via phone hotspot (still doesn’t work) Since this is clearly account-specific and affecting multiple players recently, it seems to require a backend authentication or token refresh by Blizzard staff to restore access. Has anyone else encountered this recently and had it resolved? I hope creating visibility here helps Blizzard escalate this for affected accounts. Thanks in advance for any advice or support!",

      "> It's clear that Ubisoft is deathly afraid of players getting bored, because if you're moving, SOMETHING is coming your way at practically all times\n\nThat's what people who like Far Cry actually like. Me and the missus loved Far Cry 5 and New Dawn (currently playing 6). It is so fun in coop. Shouting at each other, trying to strategize to take down bases. Also, Far Cry 5 is so extremely photorealistic for its time. Far Cry 6 is also great but the lack of activity i.e. not enough people/bases/animals to take down is a bit of a letdown.",
      "Ubisoft is all the issues with the wRPG metastasized. I have hangups about games as storytelling vehicles anyway, but IMO it simply comes down to that narrative requires structure and context. The more you open an experience in the way wRPGs feel the need to, the more they rely on facilitating fleeting emergent narratives rather than effectively curating a more cohesive one. This isn't exactly a problem UNLESS the primary point of your artistic project is to tell a specific story in a specific manner.",
      "Bizarre take to see on truegaming. First of all, you're playing an Assassin's Creed game. You don't need to worry about making a bad commitment because the game requires virtually none of it, and you will never face a meaningful challenge that will depend on how your \"build\" works. If you don't like even this miniscule, meaningless level of decision making, the solution isn't to keep it in but to make it even more meaningless, it's to remove it entirely.\n\nUbisoft has already done this in the past with Breakpoint by adding a separate mode that removes the RPG component of the game, and guess what, it was actually so meaningless and superficial that removing it had basically zero impact on the actual game.\n\nGoing beyond Ubisoft games, this is just an incredibly shitty approach to video games. There are games that are there to indulge a casual power fantasy. Plenty offer you to play on easy or \"story\" mode where you don't have to worry about making decisions and can just relax if that's all you want.\n\nOutside that, the things you mentioned have a place in games and shouldn't be \"fixed\" by allowing a low effort way to avoid any sort of commitment or strategy. Losing progress due to a bad build can be frustrating, but in a well built game, it would always be a result of your own mistakes or shortcomings, which you can solve by improving and learning.\n\nThis isn't even a \"git gud\" message, the point is that if you don't want to engage with the game's mechanics, the solution isn't to make those mechanics meaningless, it's for you to play something else.",
      "I get ur point, but to be honest, the fact ubisoft has 3 different studios working on 3 different games at the same time is already a big issue and will just cause a repeat of Valhalla, Mirage, and Shadows. The modern day is what connected all ac games in the first place, and letting different studios work on different ac games at the same time means the writing will stay the same without improving. If ubisoft rly wants to go back to the glory days of ac, they would put all their resources into making one game at a time with good writing, mechanics, and all that. \n\nNo other studio (at least from what I've heard) works on multiple entries to a series at the same time.",
      "I wouldn’t say stuck - mirage exists and was liked (no idea if it sold well) enough to get DLC. Paid for my outside sources but that’s another conversation. So maybe we’ll get more spins off titles.\n\nSomething new was always kinda going to happen with AC after the successes of other open world games and Ubisofts own failures. Trying something new, while expanding to a new market & maintain some core aspects may not be perfecting it how OP might have wanted, but taking the best bits and placing them in a different game/style to more or less save AC as a franchise, is definitely a step to perfecting. \n\nNo one sets out to make a bad game. With each game Ubisoft try to perfect their new ideas. It’s just not always the nostalgic dream players want.\n\nEDIT: typos",
      "My conspiracy theory is that Ubisoft just wanna make simulator games because the only thing they seem to put effort into these days is graphics and then spitting out a story last minute that they made using AI so they can slap the Assassin's Creed title on it. I don't know why Ubisoft devs don't just become architects, their craft would be more respected there and not tarnished by constant weak storylines, retcons, outlandish albeit funny missions (I'll never forget the side quest in Odyssey where I fucked some dudes dad and killed his mother or where I had to satisfy an old woman's sexual urges thus cucking her husband and plowing as an entire moon cycle passed) and bizarre plot holes (wtf happened to Juno?)",
      "It's sad how much people hate on Ubisoft. They have made some outstanding games, and the amount of content and enjoyment available is staggering. \n\nAC, Far Cry, Ghost Recon, The Division.. just examples of my favorites, and each of those franchises have multiple games some of which are really really good. \n\nThe hate Ubi gets upsets me because I know so many people are missing out on so much great gaming, bur also because the more sheep adhere to this idea, the less money Ubi makes and the more they will change their games by chasing trends in a futile attempt to appeal to normie hater consumers. It also leads to them putting scumbag monetization tactics in their games, which just causes people to hate them even more. I wish they stop making stupid decisions and stick to what makes their games so good.",
      "With Unity, Ubisoft was ambitious as hell and threw everything in to maximize the \"Assassin's Creed\" experience.  But they didn't get enough time to finish polishing performance or fix bugs, so at release it was generally quite panned.  After Unity, they scaled everything back so it wouldn't all be too big for the hardware, and with Origins they dumped the yearly-release-franchise model and opted for a more \"vanilla flavored\" action RPG experience that would be easier to program and animate.\n\nHopefully since Mirage they'll be back into emphasizing the franchise as a series of stealth games rather than action RPGs.",
      "Ubisoft kinda hit two very unique ideas at the same time with Assassin's Creed - medieval GTA and \"blade in the crowd\" pseudostealth power fantasy. And it hit both in a flawed way. They also made an absolutely marvelous philosophical game, but those who prefer it are few.\n\nThey tried to keep both of those ideas intact with Ezio and along with refining their ideas, they hit gold with the character. After exhausting that they started to struggle to cater to both. And medieval GTA is easier to understand to money people and is a lower common denominator. Then came in Ashraf Ismail and co who basically said - fuck Assassins, we have opportunity for all kinds of cool settings. Thus Black Flag, Origins and Valhalla. Games that excelled at their premise but were dragged down by the Assassin part they really didn't want to be connected to and tried to move away from.\n\nAll Ubi had to do was to spin off the \"social stealth\" games under new name and they'd be in a much healthier spot. But they were chasing that \"monogame design\" approach which is the exact opposite of catering to different game premise fans with varied product lines.",
      "The graphics for this game are very well made and the game runs exceptionally well considering i'm using a windows xp sh*tbox i got off bing, but the graphics are beside the point, i didnt know what was going on while i was playing this game consistently feeling lost as if i was trying to find my way out Ubisofts basement. other than the backrooms aesthetic feel in the gameplay the controls gave me the sense that the dev team couldnt decide where to bind the keys and instead just dragged their fat t*ts across the keyboard for random inputs, once i finished the tutorial i heard a knock at my door but when i went to answer it, i saw one of the developers fat t*ts hanging through the door mailbox, as i opened it a fat, sweaty, greasy developer fell on top of me, i couldnt breath, when i woke up i was in a wheelchair and my ribs were fractured into over 200 pieces and my lungs were collapsed and torn, i now have permanent breathing damage for life."

      "It's pretty mental that this is the worlds patch and matches start in exactly seven days. I sure love teams playing the biggest tournament of the year with pretty much no time to figure out the patch.\n\nWell, anything to ncrease the odds of western teams going far and T1 winning I guess!",
      "what r u complaining about? That you cant op gg a guy to flame him mid game?? You already couldnt in lobby. ",
      "Doesn't it become a solved game if they generally balance champions and have a couple of champions that they randomly decide should be stronger than the other champions, just pick as many of those champions as possible",
      "It will never be solved... That's impossible given the number of champions and variety of matchups, items, skill brackets, etc...\n\nOPs not saying it should be \"solved\". They're saying Riot should balance in reaction to the natural evolution of the game as players innovate new strategies, adapt to new items, runes, champ updates, builds, etc... like it seemingly was for years. Rather than what Riot is doing right here, and themselves choosing which champions get the stamp of approval to shape the meta.",
      "> Riot has always been clear that they dont want League to be a \"solved\" game, i.e. all champs sitting at roughly a 50% wr.\n\nThis plays a major role in league's longevity as a game. The meta would be completely stagnant if every champ were balanced.",
      "A solved game doesn’t mean a game with perfect balance. It’s a game where the best move is already predetermined. That’s just impossible with the complexity of league especially when you take mechanical skill into account. \n\nHow does making every champion pickable make metas stale? Instead of having the best 5 options in a role you suddenly have every option and can still win.",
      "Everyone hates objective oriented league up until a Tryndamere that nobody can match takes all their towers and brute force end the game."

The only changes I’d consider are 1. Adding a bit of weight to the odds for maps that receive few votes 2. Add 2cp back to QP and let democracy decide if we want to play it",

I just ragequitted a game before it started, because 9 players chose a map and 1 guy trolled and guess who won: the troll!!! This needs immediate rework. Just be democratic and let the majority win. Do you want a president to win the election when he gets only 20% votes? NO!!! So just follow democracy, gooosh! Please use your brain blizzard. RANT OVER",
      "Constantly seeing games where it is obvious that we want to play one map, someone picks their map and an 8-1 ends up picking the map that 1 person wanted. So we all have to play their map… that isnt democracy it is just plain irritating. Just let the highest voted win.",

Of course you're free to do that.\n\nIt is my opinion that BG3 isn't that great. It's not a bad game, it's good.

      "Im dumb. Can you explain if I were 5?  \nDoes the embedded Vanguard has no more access, deeper privileges on the system than the game itself?\n\nIf it has I'm just deleting lol. It was fine on my PC as it was only for gaming until I sold it. But to see this on my Mac. 100% deleting the game.",
      "No. Embedded vanguard is using an approved set of Apple API's to verify the process integrity, there are no additional permissions beyond what League already had the capability of doing. macOS has very strict application sandboxing, everything League has access to is something you must approve.\n\nExample System Settings -> Security and Privacy -> Screen and System Recording. Is League in there? Does League ask for it? If it's not in there and not asked for the application has zero access to do so, embedded vanguard doesn't change that as it's using Apple's DeviceCheck API to verify process integrity but that doesn't give the application any additional permissions merely gives developers a way to harden an application from being interfered with by another running application like in this case cheats or bots.\n\nThere's also for example a files and folders access setting in privacy and security. You will find the League client in there as it asks for access to the Documents folder for saving and reading highlights and replays. In theory the application could go rogue and read/write whatever it wants in there but that's always been the case and you're trusting the application by enabling that access. You could even technically deny it and league would still run but fail to download replays or save highlights.\n\nYou're 100% safe to continue using League of Legends on your Mac with Vanguard and I say this as someone very critical of the Windows implementation. macOS has a very well designed application sandboxing implementation and utilizing the DeviceCheck API as anti-cheat is an Apple designed and approved way of doing so that will continue to honor and utilize the same sandbox design. You have nothing to worry about.\n\nI'll add a 'what if they try' scenario to this as well. Let's say they did go rogue and wanted full disk access or to take screenshots, they can't just do this, the operating system will ask you if you want to grant that level of access and you could rightly click deny as you should. If it did go rogue and want that deep of access then we can very rightly ask Riot to explain themselves and make whatever judgement we want to from there but until that happens it's not something to be worried about.",
      "This is just bullshit. I'm sorry. macOS has very strict sandboxing, the League Client has access to the Documents folder and nothing more and this is EASILY verifiable for each and every Mac user by simply looking at the application file access in Privacy and Security settings.\n\nLeague does not have Full Disk Access. League has some file level access but it's limited to the Documents folder. It also doesn't have access to do any screen and system audio recording. Again EASILY verifiable and IF the client ever tried to access those things you'd get a security prompt asking to enable it (every Mac user has gone through dozens of these to access the Microphone and access the screen for like Discord sharing or audio/video conferencing applications). \n\nEmbedded Vanguard is using the DeviceCheck API which is developed and supported by Apple, it grants ZERO additional permissions and if for some reason the League client tried to access all the files on your disk or take screenshots it would be flat out denied until you clicked approve. Now if suddenly League asks for those permissions it's a different discussion but it's not something they can just slip by a macOS user so let's not pretend that's what is going on.",
      "Typicall r/leagueoflegends doesnt know shit about computers or how companies actually apy on users. Even though Apple does restrict things, it can still screenshot any window based on parameter sent by the server. Dont believe put it through IDA pro… oh wait this is r/leagueoflegends no one here even knows what that is and has probably never heard of reverse engineering"

Why would the cosmetics only show up when playing on Xbox if they’re technically in my locker? Like I should still be able to use them despite being on my PlayStation. Is this something they’re going to fix? I don’t know why it would matter which system I’m using if I legitimately pay for gamepass every month and I have an Xbox I play on….",

I already have a gamepass xbox account linked to my account and when I logged in on PC I had gotten everything your supposed to get (previous shop skins, prisims, etc.) BUT when I logged back on to playstation I dont seem to have any of the skins.

However, whoever put it back together... \n\nThe question for this guy is, how did he even get the job?\n\nThey put thermal paste over the liquid metal. The liquid metal was everywhere except where it was supposed to be. Of course the console would shut down after 2 minutes of use. When he took it back to the service center they told him there was no way to fix it because the board was gone now, he didn't want to mess with them and brought it to me.\n\nI believe him, because he's not the first to come up with the same claim.",

They had to spend a lot of the revenue they got from 2077 on fixing 2077. They were pretty clear that financially they needed to pivot and get another win to get themselves back on solid financial footing. Unless Sony threw cash at them, I don’t see them spending any time or resources on the pro, particularly when the adoption rate has been so low.",

He was bored by the 3rd game it was so repetitive, and often he had no clue what was happening because there was so much visual clutter and noise and it was just a big mess. I won’t link the video as people always seem to complain about promoting content creators for some reason (although I guess this post talks about one so the haters will arrive anyway). Worth watching the first 3 games to see how bored he is by the 3rd. Pretty much sums up my experience. Terrible hero to play, terrible hero to play with, terrible hero to play against. Well done design team!!",

Zero incentive to reconnect or win now.\n\nPeople say \"don't be an assholr! Think of your teammates!\". The teammates that I've known for 15-20 minutes?

Everyone needed to be offline at the exact moment catchup xp was calculated (the krug being killed), 0 players online means dividing the amount by 0, at the exact moment the calculation happened. This results in an insane/unrealistic number being created and applied. It was crazy lucky that it even happened to begin with.\n\nFrom my understanding the region that this took place in was experiencing internet outages giving a moment where the stars then aligned for this to actually happen in a real game.",

The simple feedback I want to give is that you should have added an Achievement or Challenge to play the heroes in the Goats composition for X matches for a reward. Nothing is driving players to play Goats. Instead they want their XP reward from playing DPS. The experience has been quite disappointing. It would be nice to prolong the event and add this new challenge or simply restrict players in playing the heroes in the Goats composition. Cheers",

      "Anyone saying he’s bad just read “no more oneshot” and went straight to the forums. Play him for one game and you know he’s S-tier this season. You just don’t miss, storm arrow deletes people.",
      "can they finally rework storm arrows the stupiest ability in the game just press e and shoot anywhere you want you dont even need aim for it its already bouncing of from walls hitting shot randomly  - who cares XD the arrow somewhere flying in the airhitbox - still hits you pathetic",
      "Someone clarify this for me: His “normal” arrows are no longer affected by the S9 projectile changes Does that mean storm arrows, sonic arrow are? (I guess his ult too with initial arrow) That seems like such a weird exception if that’s what’s going on",
      "Do you wintess same? Also Hanzo storm arrows laggy and not consistent shooting rate, sound is insanely buggy. I know many companies were created in the garage of their houses, but it seems Blizzard now went back there…",
      "WP TEAM 4 after all brainless changes and reverts you just actually broke something with these LOGS that apparently fall somewhere to the ground and only hit AIR storm arrow sound is broken since release of mythic skin sonic arrow animation is BROKEN on several skins, including mythic and valentine skins, the arrow just visually drop on ground as if it was not charged at all, no matter how long you draw GREAT QUALITY JOB BROS 1300+ hours on hanzo and i only hit AIR, even half of perfectly aimed arrows are NO REGS and those shots i actually HIT do only come from actual spam and feel absurdly rigged this just can’t be any more rigged than this, its just comically bad",
      "As title says, I see plenty times arrow go through players and not registering a hit, not even a body shot! I checked latency and I m allways 30-50 ms, so it cannt be with that and it does only since patch. Here is a image of clear headshot with REGULAR shot!!! Not Storm arrow which was nerfed!!! I think Blizzard saw raging people and they changed that not every hit is registered by him. Clear game manipulation. imgur. com/a/1byKhY1 - yes the green is my arrow, and he was even moving to his right!!! Wtf is that?",

      "> And the flood already were introduced in 343 Guilty Spark.\n\nThey were, but not as the relentless hordes you face in The Library or see most of the later times you encounter the Flood. They were more of a lurking threat, and one that ended up being extremely easy to take care of at that since Flood with guns were extremely rare on that level.\n\n> Just the fact that the rooms are so hard to distinguish from one another meant that they added literal arrows in the remaster just so you don't get lost.\n\nI mean the same could be said for like, literally every level wandering around in the featureless Forerunner architecture lol. The Library is far from the only level that had this issue and the arrows were added everywhere in the campaign. I got turned around in Two Betrayals way more than in The Library because TB actually asks you to backtrack repeatedly, not to mention all of the arrows they placed were mostly facing backwards this time because it was a retrace of a previous level lmao\n\nIdk what the popular consensus is, all I know is that Two Betrayals made me groan and say \"how is this shit *still going*\" multiple times, while I honestly didn't have any immediate reaction to The Library other than frantically fending off swarms of Flood. I guess the constant running/fighting for my life distracted from the level design just enough.",
      "Their last 3 announcements/interviews have been bungles as bad as I have ever seen, and here you are saying it's the communities fault. You shouldn't worry too much, it's pretty clear they've lost half their user base to superior products and their bungling over the last month. Doughnut punchers should be all that's left soon enough.\n\nArrowhead has bent over backwards to make a game most of their fans don't want, and their response has consistently been \"we never wanted those fans anyway.\""

That is why we had hextech chests in the first place, and its why Overwatch is adding their loot crates back into their game, and why Marvel Rivals is responsive to community feedback and stuffs their battle pass with good skins and premium currency kickbacks. Riot is pretending their players have no other options/choices but there are a shit ton of live service games that are improving their F2P/freemium(battlepass/low spenders) offerings at the same time that riot is cutting back.",
      "Yeah this year really has changed league forever. Just like the release of Overwatch 2 they are doing everything to make me not open the game. Make skins more expensive and lower quality, remove free skins and free rewards, remove clash, remove my shop. Feels like a Blizzard game at this point I'm out.",

      "Not really, I am being forced into a 15mins dodge timer because someone can't play anything other than one champ. There are 170 champs in the game, if you can't play one of them for one game and you throw a fit, that's on you. I don't wanna play against or with certain champs and that's my freedom that shouldn't be taken away. If people are using this to grief, then that's a behavior to detect and punish.",
      "I don't really understand this change. If for example I don't want Shaco in my games, for either team, why is my desire for fun less important than the Shaco player? I'm not talking about spite banning it when I see it hovered to be clear, I'm saying in the case of [insert mini game style champ] being my permaban in every lobby.",

      "Yep, this! So much this!\n\nWhenever it comes up on Reddit people come out of their holes and yell \"strategy\".  \nYet not once I have seen it use that way. NOT ONCE!\n\nIt's always trolling, target banning your own team mates, resulting in a toxicity spiral.  \nEVERY. SINGLE. TIME.\n\n(New Champ releases may be another topic, personally I don't mind it and think it's quite healthy, but I see why people would not like it in this case.)",
      "Can’t wait to get flamed or trolled by someone with a ‘hide my everything’ profile toggled on who probably has 1300 games played this season and does not care anymore. ",
      "Why are they catering to one player whos playstyle negatively influenced so many players. Everytime your lobby contains a baus fanboy the game will be miserable for both teams.",
      "Just think about how often do you win games when your mates keep spamming /ff, doesn't take two brains to notice that people don't know how to end games when they have the advantage, unless they play well (hence the master comment)\n\nI'm not master, that's why I know that, that's the point"

      "valorant still has loads of hackers what is your point?\n\n  \nedit: idiot!",
      "> Thats something I can still track down, I cannot track down a kernel driver in the same way\n\nCan you? Genuinely now for a second, would you ever be able to tell that one of the 50 svchost.exes running at any given time is a malicious one? There's practically no way to ever tell what any of them are -actually- doing on your system.\n\n>If you look into what a rootkit is (effectively vanguard could be considered a rootkit IF it becomes malicious) then you will know if you are infected, the worst case scenario is you need to get completely new hardware and you cant connect anything to the old to transfer\n\nWhile true that having Kernel level access makes this easier, there have been rootkits that were (and there's probably some out there that still are) able to infect UEFI without even administrator permissions, by far the biggest hurdle when it comes to compromising machines isn't permissions, it's getting your code to execute at all and at least in riots case they already are past the biggest hurdle.",
      "Well im in a special spot, i am forced to know a lot about security because of my job. On top of that theres a lot of invasive security measures on my work laptop that I need to be familiar with. I also have experience looking into the svchost.exe using tools like the windows [process explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) (not the ctrl alt del one), TCPView, Ghidra, and more.\n\nI also had a side project where I loaded windows 10 with as few things running in the background as possible and it still functioning (i wanted to see the impact on gaming performance, i stripped pretty much every feature and really trimmed the fat).\n\nSo while I agree most people wouldn't know how to track it down, I do. I am pretty familiar with how to research what each svchost.exe process is started with. It gets tougher the more effort is put into masking it, but its possible.\n\nWith vanguard its not possible because I simply do not have the permissions to access it, and since it runs first I cannot even create my own thing to run ahead of it (obviously it would detect it as a compromised system because my stuff isnt signed).\n\nWith that said, I don't really buy into the china crap. (hence why its not an issue for me that they executed the code on my computer). The bigger issue to me is that riot isnt exactly a secure company, the reason vanguard is being installed is because of a databreach they had in the past, so where is my guarantee that it wont happen in the future? Does Riot have any security audits they can post? Nope. Just \"dude trust me bro we good, we self audited and we have a bounty\" (pretty much every large corpo has a bounty for bugs found, including microsoft, except microsoft has a large list of compliances they adhere to as well).\n\nI uninstalled league, but I also moved all of my things I want to keep secure off of my gaming computer so now it really doesnt matter as much to me, im just not sure if i care enough to reinstall league or not.",
      "> So while I agree most people wouldn't know how to track it down, I do\n\nThe point I was making isn't if you could know to track it down, it's if you'd ever suspect something is happening, assuming you're on windows there's a bunch of svchosts running right now, would you actually bother to analyze every single one just on the off chance that one of them -might- be a malicious one?\n\n>the reason vanguard is being installed is because of a databreach they had in the past\n\nIs it though? Scripters and Botters have been rampant for many years now, way before the leak.  \n\n I wouldn't be surprised if the leak made things worse but it's not like their previous anti cheat was doing it's job well.  \n\n>so where is my guarantee that it wont happen in the future? Does Riot have any security audits they can post? Nope. Just \"dude trust me bro we good, we self audited and we have a bounty\"\n\nI mean, even with a passed external audit its always possible for a company to fall victim to a hack, there's always the possibility of a zero day in some part of their infrastructure, but then again, I doubt anyone would \"waste\" one on Riot though, there's juicier targets, the fact that nobody was able to find a vulnerability in Vanguard so far (at least that we know of) though at least to me is a good sign.",
      "You definitely don't need kernel level access to install keyloggers or to read user files and shit like that. Any program you run on your PC can do literally everything the user can do. Discord could install a keylogger and steal all your passwords and bank info. Steam could steal all your documents. Photoshop could activate your mic and webcam and record you in secret. League could delete system32.\n\nThis is why they tell you to only open files you trust. If Riot wanted your personal data, they would already have it and Vanguard won't change anything.",
      "I truly hope that some teenagers hack into Riot and brick or post some stupid screensavers to all the devices just so people can sit back and realize how fucking dangerous this shit is. It was generally okay before and with the exception of tiktok there wasn't really a massive pile of devices that one could get access over and Riot is there posting 100K bounties to hackers who can hack it when 100K is nothing to 220M devices.",
      "Yeah, I guess I now have to buy another PC so a random can belive I care about digital security.",
      "Literally just cut the internet off of Vanguard in your firewall. Like Idk why you're creating conspiracy theories for tbh, if you're too concerned about privacy then install an open source firewall and cut the internet off of everything riot related when you're done playing"
